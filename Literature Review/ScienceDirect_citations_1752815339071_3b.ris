AB  - With the change of global climate, extreme weather is happening more and more frequently. As a typical extreme weather, extreme drought seriously endangers the safety of wetland ecosystem. In this study, remote sensing technology was used to compare the landscape pattern of Dongting Lake (DL, the second largest freshwater lake in China) wetland in normal year, drought year and wet year, to reveal the influence of extreme drought/wetness on landscape pattern. The results showed that extreme drought caused the expanding of grass to mudflat. On landscape metrics, extreme drought caused significant changes in IJI, CONTAG, ED, SIDI, SHDI, SHEI, landscape diversity and landscape heterogeneity decreased significantly; on class metrics, extreme drought caused significant changes in CA, MPS, AI, the degree of fragmentation is reduced and the landscape connectivity is enhanced. These changes will affect various migratory birds living in the DL wetland. Additionally, we also discovered that, in contrast to extreme drought, extreme wetness has a relatively minor influence on the DL wetland, and their impacts on landscape fragmentation are contrary.

AB  - Combining multiple methods offers a practical approach to studying long-term variations in the urban green space cold island(GSCI) effect. This research integrates remote sensing inversion and numerical simulation to investigate the annual cycle of the GSCI in Huachong Park, Hefei City. Initially, 59 remote sensing images from various seasons between 2010 and 2020 were retrieved using Landsat series image data and atmospheric correction methods to invert Land Surface Temperatures(LST), which preliminary identified the GSCI's annual cycle variations. Subsequently, meteorological data for Hefei from 2010 to 2020 were extracted using the Solar Terms Typical Meteorological Day(STTMD) method to obtain representative annual meteorological data. These data were then input into the ENVI-met software for numerical simulations of the study area, capturing diurnal variations of the cold island effect at 24-time points and predicting annual changes in cold island intensity. The results indicate that: (1) The GSCI exhibits an annual cycle and seasonal variations characterized by “strong in summer and weak in winter, cooler in summer and warmer in winter”; (2) A progressive relationship exists between remote sensing inversion and ENVI-met numerical simulation in studying the temporal variation of the GSCI, with the integration of these methods yielding a more comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of the GSCI over long-term scales;(3) The STTMD method effectively simplifies representative meteorological data, progressively combining remote sensing retrievals and numerical simulations to facilitate the acquisition of comprehensive spatiotemporal variations of the green space heat effect over extended periods. These findings advance understanding of the long-term dynamics of cold island effects within urban green spaces, providing valuable insights for urban planners and environmental researchers.

AB  - Farmland landscapes are intuitive indicators of the functions of farmland ecosystems. However, geographical differences complicate the spatio-temporal evolutionary characteristics of farmland landscape systems, making them difficult to explore. This creates a series of difficulties in designing farmland management policy in China's diversified geographical environment. This study aims to explore the evolution of laws and dynamic mechanisms of farmland landscape structural changes in different geographical environments at the provincial level in China. A landscape structure classification model at the pixel level was developed using the principles of range attenuation in geographical space and ecological boundary effects to identify the spatial characteristics of the degradation processes in farmland landscapes. A redundancy analysis (RDA) investigated the human and natural causes of farmland landscape degradation processes. The results demonstrate that the farmland landscape systems in Jiangsu Province degraded between the 1980s and 2010 on a spatial gradient with human geography: the beginnings of industrialisation → rapid industrialisation → completion of industrialisation. Degradation manifested temporal and spatial differentiation as follows: fragmentation via the joint activities of invasion from non-agricultural boundaries and internal wedging → fragmentation caused by non-agricultural internal wedging → fragmentation caused by boundary invasion. The core causal factors of degradation were development intensity and the extent of construction land, which indicate changes in socioeconomic development. Industrialisation and rapid urbanisation increased the development intensity of human construction, which disrupted the connections among farmland landscapes through boundary invasions or discontinuous occupations. This subsequent fragmentation of farmland landscape patterns degraded the productive and ecological functions of farmlands. This study indicates that development intensity around agricultural environments should be strictly controlled which would be beneficial for the design of farmland conservation policies and land management in China.

AB  - Wetlandscapes are vulnerable to land conversion and sediment infilling from upland agriculture, causing them to act as sinks for sediment deposition and putting at risk their ecosystem services. Wetlandscapes in the Canadian Prairies agroecosystems are particularly susceptible to sediment infilling because of the intensification of human activities and agricultural practices. The rising risk of soil erosion in cultivated landscapes has generated a need to estimate soil redistribution rates and soil loss monitoring tools and techniques. This research examines the effects of agricultural activities on soil loss and sedimentation rates within agricultural landscapes in the Canadian Prairies. Land and atmospheric fluxes of sediment into wetlands are quantified over the past 60 years using catchment-scale tracing (137Cs) and budgeting techniques. Findings indicate that the pattern of 137Cs erosion/deposition varies along catchment toposequences, with erosion near the top of the toposequences (the average annual soil erosion rates were found to be 1.1 kg m−2 yr−1 for Manitoba and 0.3 kg m−2 yr−1 for Alberta) and deposition within the wetland ecosystem (total deposition rates were estimated at about −3.6 kg m−2 yr-1for Manitoba and −0.9 kg m−2 yr−1 for Alberta). The sediment delivery ratios were approximately 57% and 35% in Manitoba and Alberta, respectively, indicating that a noticeable amount of the mobilized sediment exits the field. These transfers from cultivated fields into wetlands reveal that wetlandscapes in Canadian Prairies are vulnerable to sediment infilling, and soil erosion control practices are needed to achieve sustainable management of agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Satellite imagery has been widely used to map urbanization processes. To address the urgent need for urban landscape mapping that goes beyond urban footprint analysis, the local climate zone (LCZ) scheme has been increasingly used to reveal the urban forms and functions important to urban heat islands and micro-climates across the globe. As with most supervised classification strategies, proper application of training data is critical for the success of LCZ classification models. However, the collection and application of LCZ training areas brings with it two challenges that may affect mapping success. First, because digitizing training areas is a time-consuming task, there is a broad effort in the LCZ mapping community to create a crowdsourced data collection among different experts. However, this strategy likely leads to inconsistencies in labels that could weaken models. Second, the LCZ labeling process typically involves the delineation of large zones from which multiple training samples are drawn, but those samples are likely spatially autocorrelated and lead to overly optimistic estimates of model accuracy. Although both effects -- inconsistent labeling and spatial autocorrelation -- are theoretically possible, it is unknown whether they substantially affect accuracy. We investigated both issues, specifically asking: (i) how do the discrepancies of LCZ labeling by different experts impact broad-scale LCZ mapping? (ii) to what extent does spatial correlation affect model prediction power? We used two classifiers (Random Forests and ResNets) to map eight metropolitan areas in the US into LCZs, comparing training areas drawn by different or consistent interpreters, and data splitting strategy using rules that allow or reduce spatial autocorrelation. We found large discrepancies among results built from crowdsourced training areas digitized by different experts; improving the consistency of labels can lead to substantial improvements in LCZ classification accuracy. Second, we found that spatial autocorrelation can boost the apparent accuracy of the classifier by 16% to 21%, leading to erroneous interpretation of mapping results. The two effects interplay as well: spatial autocorrelation in the raw data can lead to an underestimation of the model’s predictive error when modeling with crowdsourced training areas of high inconsistency. Due to the uncertainty in the labeling process and spatial autocorrelation in derived training data, broad-scale LCZ mapping results should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - EU agricultural landscapes are vital for biodiversity. Intensive agricultural practices constitute, however, key drivers of biodiversity loss. The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 aims to restore “at least 10 % of agricultural area under high-diversity landscape features”, yet it lacks specific guidance for assessment and implementation. Here, we develop an approach to (a) map and assess agricultural landscape features (LF) cover at a landscape scale, (b) cluster agricultural landscapes by complexity using both compositional and configurational heterogeneity metrics, and (c) prioritise landscapes and sites for LF restoration by targeting areas of lower productivity and higher erosion risk, to enhance farmer acceptance and increase restoration benefits. Using Brandenburg, Germany, as a case study, we found that 94.4 % of landscapes fall short of the 10 % landscape features cover target. We categorised five agricultural landscape types ranging from simple to complex mosaics. At the local scale, in ten randomly selected landscapes, we identified an additional 11 % of agricultural areas on which LF could be restored. Our study helps advance methodologies to prioritise LF restoration. It can provide guidance for administrators and planners to assess the LF status and advance their adoption by farmers. We recommend prioritising landscapes and selecting restoration actions based on overall landscape complexity assessment. At the local scale, we recommend participatory processes involving local stakeholders. We believe our methodology is transferable to other EU regions, and highlights both the opportunities and challenges in developing a standardised, EU-wide approach for prioritising LF restoration to support agroecological transitions in Europe.

AB  - In the Yangtze River Delta in China, known for its intricate water network, achieving harmonious development between humans and nature in rural areas is imperative. However, the identification of the water-net landscape characteristics and the relationship between rural sustainability and these landscape characteristics remain unclear. The aim of this study was to bridge this gap by proposing a novel framework for investigating the relationship between landscape characteristics and rural sustainability from a typo-morphological perspective. Specifically, through regression analysis, the influence of multilevel spatial characteristics of rural landscape on sustainability was selected as the research focus. First, multilevel metrics were introduced to delineate the rural landscape characteristics, including single and multiple landscape elements and landscape types, using deep learning methods to achieve automatic classification. Subsequently, by employing an improved entropy method, we comprehensively quantified rural sustainability indicators from the economic, social, and ecological dimensions. Finally, the ordinary least squares (OLS) model and two spatial variation coefficient models, namely, geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), were used to quantitatively analyze the relationship between the landscape characteristics and rural sustainability. Significant regression model performances were obtained with adjusted R2 values of 0.33, 0.35, and 0.4 at each landscape characteristic level. The adjusted R2 values for the GWR and MGWR, which incorporated all of the landscape characteristics metrics, were 0.84 and 0.88, respectively. The results demonstrate that rural sustainability highly depends on the proposed multilevel characteristics and exhibits spatial heterogeneity. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the typo-morphological characteristics of the landscape and provide important planning and decision-making references for sustainable development in rural areas.

AB  - To assess wildfire risk linked to lightning-caused wildfires, the present study tests the spatial- and temporal-scale distribution variability of lightning fires in Western Canada between 1981 and 2018. We examined clustering, trends, distances between clusters, and the fire season. For this study, the nearest neighbours, K-function, Moran's I, Mann–Kendall, and the Getis-ord Gi* statistics were used. These statistics were visualized by a Space Time Cube model with a hexagon grid. Lightning-ignited wildfires cluster spatially up to 270 km with an observed overall nonsignificant decreasing trend for the number of fires. Overall, northeastern Alberta, central Saskatchewan, and southeastern British Columbia show clustering of lightning fires. In June, there is significant clustering in northwestern and eastern Alberta, while in July fires cluster in northeastern Alberta and in southeastern British Columbia. In August, fire clusters occurred only in southeastern and south-central British Columbia. These results highlight regions that are experiencing persistent lightning fire clustering activity. This provides a focal point to assess wildfire risk to communities and values at risk, while informing local and regional management agencies in preparedness, resource capacity management, and detection. Additionally, it provides a baseline for future research into biophysical modelling of wildfire initiations.

Nous avons examiné les regroupements, les tendances, les distances entre les regroupements et la saison des feux. Pour cette étude, les statistiques des plus proches voisins, de la fonction K, du I de Moran, de Mann–Kendall et du Getis-ord Gi* ont été utilisées. Ces statistiques ont été visualisées par un modèle Space Time Cube avec une grille hexagonale. Les incendies de forêt déclenchés par la foudre se regroupent dans l'espace jusqu'à 270 km avec une tendance générale non significative à la baisse du nombre d'incendies. Dans l'ensemble, le nord-est de l'Alberta, le centre de la Saskatchewan et le sud-est de la Colombie-Britannique présentent des regroupements de feux provoqués par la foudre. En juin, on observe un regroupement significatif dans le nord-ouest et l'est de l'Alberta, tandis qu'en juillet, les feux se regroupent dans le nord-est de l'Alberta et dans le sud-est de la Colombie-Britannique. En août, les regroupements de feux ne se sont produits que dans le sud-est et le centre-sud de la Colombie-Britannique. Ces résultats mettent en évidence les régions qui connaissent une activité persistante de regroupement des feux de foudre. Cela fournit un point focal pour évaluer le risque d'incendie de forêt pour les communautés et les valeurs à risque, tout en informant les agences de gestion locales et régionales en matière de préparation, de gestion de la capacité des ressources et de détection. De plus, cela fournit une base de référence pour les recherches futures sur la modélisation biophysique des débuts d'incendies de forêt.

AB  - The Yellow River Delta (YRD), a wetland ecosystem formed by the interactions of the river, sea, and land, is influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors. Understanding the characteristics of wetland landscape evolution in this region and its key driving factors is crucial for advancing wetland protection and restoration. This paper investigates the dynamics of wetland landscape evolution in the YRD from 1980 to 2023, and quantifies the impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors on this evolution, including their relative contribution rates. The results showed that over the past 40 years, the YRD has lost more than 63 % of its natural wetland area, primarily transforming into aquafarms, salt fields, and farmland. The fragmentation of the wetland landscape has increased, with decreased connectivity, and distinct spatial characteristics. Human activities, water-sediment fluxes, and nearshore hydrodynamics are closely related to wetland landscape evolution, with relative contribution rates of 49.41 %, 31.08 %, and 16.17 %, respectively. This study provides valuable insights for enhancing wetland ecological conservation efforts in the YRD.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the understanding of rainfall extremes by analyzing large datasets and utilizing predictive analytics. AI offers comprehensive insights into rainfall extremes through data collection and analysis, predictive analytics, climate modeling, and the development of early warning systems. This advancement in AI technology has the potential to significantly enhance the understanding and management of rainfall extremes in Africa, leading to improved adaptation and sustainable development strategies in the continent. Amid significant improvements in computer performance, lots of data, and better technology, scientists are focusing on studying extreme rainfall. These complicated and unpredictable weather events have a substantial impact on various socioeconomic sectors. This work showcases the use of different machine learning algorithms to understand rainfall extremes in Africa. Accurate identification and sorting of these events are essential in predicting floods caused by heavy rain in rivers. The work explores the details of critical rain conditions by exploring a case study using rainfall dataset assembled from 22 stations situated in the four agroecological zones in Ghana. Five different ways of training were tested using historical data, for the period 1980–2019. The focus was on accuracy and completeness of the results. The main goal is to improve the accuracy of predicting rain by understanding how rain and no-rain patterns differ in different parts of Africa. The results show that the Random Forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithms are good at dealing with unequal numbers of different kinds of data. Decision tree (DT) works quickly, while RF, XGB, and multilayer perceptron consistently show strong skills. However, the not-so-good results of K-nearest neighbor need more investigation. This research improves how to predict rain for informed planning in different parts of Africa.

AB  - The assessment of landscape multifunctionality is critical for making informed decisions about landscape resource allocation, optimization, and planning. However, accurately estimating multifunctionality has been a challenging issue, and whether heterogeneous landscapes can promote multifunctionality is still unclear. In our study, we developed a comprehensive computational framework for assessing landscape multifunctionality in agro-forestry interlacing zones. Our study considered both the quality and quantity of multifunctionality by using an improved incremental thresholds method. Compared to homogeneous landscapes, heterogeneous landscapes have greater potential to maintain high levels of multifunctionality in terms of both quality and quantity. Moreover, we have conducted an analysis of the peak multifunctionality performance to establish the optimal threshold, with the aim of striking a balance between the quality and quantity of multifunctionality. Specifically, the optimal thresholds for agro-forest landscapes were 60% and 55%, respectively. Our study showed the distinct combinatorial arrangements of functions observed across various thresholds, thereby discerning the potentially dominant function in the landscape. The potential dominant function of agro-forestry landscapes was carbon sequestration, which could significantly contribute to achieving carbon neutrality goals. These findings are instructive for land managers and policy formulators working to achieve “win–win” sustainable development.

AB  - Flow cessation leads to severe degradation of river corridor landscape structure, habitat quality, and ecological functions. This study focuses on the representative river with ceased flow in northern China, the Yongding River plain section. Utilizing long-term, high-resolution satellite remote sensing imagery and the InVEST model, we analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution of landscape structure and habitat quality (HQ) before and after river corridor flow cessation over the past 50 years. The study further employs partial least squares regression (PLSR) to explore the impact of landscape structural changes on HQ and uses generalized additive models (GAMs) and geographical detector (GeoDetector) to quantitatively identify key factors affecting habitat degradation and their interactive effects. Results indicate that from 1967 to 2018, mid-channel bar, floodplain, and waterbody decreased sharply from 37.4% to 3.8%. The mean HQ value dropped from 0.58 to 0.34 after flow cessation. Although HQ slightly recovered post-2004, high-quality habitat areas remain absent. Different landscape structures significantly influence HQ, with increased size and area of the waterbody and forest patches positively contributing, while cultivated land, barren land, and built-up land generally have negative impacts. PLAND, LPI, MPS, and AWMPFD are key metrics for optimizing landscape structure and implementing habitat restoration in river management. Anthropogenic activities emerged as the primary driver of river corridor habitat degradation post-flow cessation. Different drivers exhibit complex linear and nonlinear effects on HQ. Based on these findings, we propose ecological management strategies for river corridors with ceased flow. This study is essential for a deeper understanding of river corridors' structural dynamics and degradation mechanisms, providing a scientific basis for effective ecological restoration and management.

Particularly since the 1970s, agriculturally driven land-use change has caused destruction of natural and semi-natural habitats, and as a consequence, severe loss of biodiversity. Hence, identifying landscape patterns and habitats that enhance species richness, and detecting species and traits that are most vulnerable to intensive land-use are prerequisites for conservation. To evaluate the effects of agricultural land-use and landscape composition on wild bees, we investigated 340 cross-transects in 34 test areas in the main agricultural regions of Austria within the framework of the biodiversity monitoring program BINATS. Using multivariate models (GLM, DCA), wild bees and potential explanatory parameters (e.g. Shannon landscape diversity index, plant diversity, flower cover) were documented, and their interrelationships analyzed. We found strong negative effects of increased agricultural land cover on species richness, abundance and functional richness. Species richness was positively correlated with an increasing area of semi-natural elements (e.g. extensive grassland, hedgerows, fallows) and the number of different habitat types, while wild bee abundance was best explained by the presence of semi-natural habitats and flower cover. Colletidae were significantly associated with the area of semi-natural elements, and were especially sensitive to agricultural intensification. Many species from communities that are present in complex landscapes disappeared in intensively managed farmland, and the majority of species decreased in response to simplified landscapes. A few species, however, even benefited. Our results emphasize the importance of diverse semi-natural elements and high regional flower cover within farmland for maintaining and enhancing species richness and abundance, and for promoting a positive spillover effect of pollinators to the surrounding agricultural landscape. Especially members of the family Colletidae, with a high proportion of specialized species, will benefit from diverse semi-natural habitat types. Given the unique importance of wild bees as pollinators of wildflowers and crops, it is crucial to improve and expand agri-environmental schemes to combat ongoing biodiversity loss in farmland.

AB  - Purpose
Bats provide many ecosystem services and have intrinsic value. They also act as host reservoirs for some viruses. Several studies have linked zoonotic diseases to bats, raising questions about the risks bats pose, especially to people living close to bat roosts. Through a series of case studies undertaken in three communities, the purpose of this paper is to explore the various ways in which framings and perceptions of bats can influence a potential spillover of bat-borne viruses to humans in Ghana. It assesses the social, cultural and economic factors that drive human-bat interactions and posits that understanding the socio-economic contexts in which human-bat interactions occur is key to the success of future communication strategies.
Design/methodology/approach
Primary data collection methods included participatory landscape mappings, transect walks, focus group discussions and questionnaire surveys.
Findings
Perceptions of bats vary and are influenced by personal beliefs, the perceived economic benefits derived from bats and the location of bat roosts. Activities that put people at risk include bat hunting, butchering and consumption of poorly prepared bat meat. Those who live and work close to bat roosts, and bat hunters, for example, are more at risk of bat-borne zoonotic disease spillover. Disease risk perceptions were generally low, with high levels of uncertainty, indicating the need for clearer information about personal protective practices.
Originality/value
The results of the study may well inform future risk communication strategies as well as help in developing effective responses to zoonotic disease risk, disease outbreaks and the conservation of bats in communities.

AB  - Farming systems in marginal or less favored areas of Europe have faced a multitude of challenges as a response to so-called “mega-trends”. A typical response has been land abandonment. The focus of this paper is on the farming systems of the Greek islands of Lesvos and Lemnos. These neighboring islands are geographically very similar but differ greatly in their farming systems, resulting in different responses to the same megatrends. While land abandonment is widespread in the small-scale olive groves of Lesvos, on Lemnos specialization towards animal and dairy products is more common. We performed land cover analysis and interviews with farmers in both areas, in two complementing rounds: one more quantitative that recorded recent changes and farmer rationales and a more qualitative one that investigated longer term trends and decision-making patterns. The analysis revealed that, among others, land ownership and inheritance patterns matter in both areas in different ways, leading to diverse trajectories. On Lemnos, as part of the traditional mixed-farming system (Mandra), land leasing is dominant, separating land users and landowners. Interviews also reveal the different symbolic capital, as olive trees on Lesvos are considered a family asset and not just a land use, something that cannot be said of the leased grazing lands on Lemnos. The market value of the different products is important, but the different trajectories also demonstrate how the rationales behind the responses to mega-trends can guide which trajectories will be dominant in the area. This article highlights the complexity and mix of local drivers and global trends that drive abandonment at both farm and the landscape scales and guides the formulation and application of agricultural policies and public resources for improved management of marginal areas.

AB  - Urban expansion results in the intrusion of artificial surfaces into natural environments, giving rise to phenomena such as urban heat islands and heightened temperatures within inhabited areas. This study examined the dynamic evolution of urban morphology and land surface temperature through the lens of local climate zone. Furthermore, the spatial relationship between urban morphology indices and land surface temperature was analyzed within the context of loops. The investigation yielded several noteworthy findings: (1) LCZ8, LCZ6, and LCZD were the most significant transfer-in and transfer-out classes within the study area. (2) The heat contribution of residential LCZs (LCZ 2,3,5) decreased over time, ranging from 0.415 to 0.171, while that of industrial LCZs (LCZ 8,10) increased within the range of 0.348–0.553. (3) Urban heat island mitigation can be achieved by regulating building height and surface fraction. Establishing a judicious threshold for reducing LST is imperative for sky view factor and impervious surface fraction factors. Surface albedo exhibited a substantial inhibitory effect in 2020. The observation of urban morphological changes and long-term local climate zone considerations integrate the responsibility of mitigating urban heat islands into urban planning.

AB  - Wetlands fulfil a number of functions in the landscape, especially non-productive ones. Information on landscape and biotope changes is important not only from a theoretical point of view for understanding the forces and pressures that cause changes in the landscape, but also from a practical point of view, as we can take inspiration from history when planning the landscape. The main goal of this study is to analyse the dynamics and trajectories of changes in wetlands, including testing the influence of the main natural conditions (climate, geomorphology) on their changes, for a large area of 141 cadastral territories (1315 km2), which will allow the results to be sufficiently generalized. The results of our study confirmed the global trend of rapid wetland loss, with almost three quarters of wetlands disappearing, mostly on arable land (37 %). The results of the study are of great importance in the field of the ecology of landscapes and wetlands, both in the national and international context, not only because they make it possible to understand the regularities and forces that affect changes in wetlands and landscapes, but also have significance due to the methodology. The specific methodology and procedure are based on the application of advanced GIS functions (Union and Intersect functions) to identify the location and area of individual change dynamics and types of wetland (new, extinct, continuous), using accurate old large-scale maps and aerial photographs. The proposed and tested methodological procedure can generally be used for wetlands in other locations, but also for studying the dynamics of changes and trajectories of other biotopes in the landscape. The greatest potential for using the results of this work in the field of environmental protection is the possibility of using the places of extinct wetlands for their restoration.

AB  - Sustainable urban planning must address multi-criteria issues, like urban heat island and outdoor thermal comfort. The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification links microclimatic measurements with morphological metadata, but multi-site comparisons are hindered by differences in background climates and landscapes. This study resolves this issue developing a methodology to identify common trends across LCZs worldwide. An application during summer daytime allowed to compare LCZ trends of air temperatures and outdoor thermal sensations. Urban vegetation emerges as a powerful means to reduce both. Generalizable LCZ insights provided by this methodology would prove highly valuable to help practitioners to identify efficient urban designs.

AB  - This study explores if and how natural capital approaches can support collaborative landscape governance. We selected six initiatives across the UK that have taken varied approaches to working with natural capital. We assessed how they have articulated, described and valued their landscapes and natural systems, and the consequences of doing so. We found that processes of systematically describing natural assets and their benefits can stimulate local investment in ecosystem markets and bring people together to co-produce plans. However, efforts to monetarily value natural capital assets were not always necessary: in some cases, new partners and resources were enroled without monetary valuations. These findings challenge the current emphasis on valuation framings in natural capital approaches. They show how natural capital approaches can help address the simultaneous challenges of connecting disparate priorities and securing new funding sources. This offers insights for international efforts to support collaborative landscape governance that delivers multiple benefits for people and nature.

AB  - Sediment deposition significantly impacts wetland biodiversity, ecological processes, and ecosystem functions. This research used the maximum likelihood method combined with the landscape pattern index to compare landscape patterns in three key periods: the beginning of the early period (EP, around 1990), the beginning period of the sediment balance (BP, around 2003), and the recent period (RP, around 2020) to assess the impact of sediment deposition on the landscape pattern of Dongting Lake (DL) and Poyang Lake (PL). In the depositional phase (from EP to BP), the findings revealed that the vegetation in the DL and PL to expand toward shoals, and shoals to expand toward water. This resulted in significant alterations to landscape pattern indices. Moreover, the magnitude of alterations in the landscape pattern of the PL wetland caused by sediment deposition is greater than that of the DL wetland. In the balance phase (from EP to BP), there were no significant changes in the areas of vegetation, shoals, and water in the DL and PL. But it caused some changes in landscape pattern indices. These series of changes will change the feeding and habitat environments of wetland birds and fish, thereby affecting wetland East Asia migratory birds and Yangtze River migratory fish.

AB  - Grassland degradation has been one of the major ecological concerns on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) in recent years, but the degradation of alpine shrub meadows, and in particular the changes in its surface landscape pattern, has been less well assessed. This study selected a warm-season pasture on the QTP as a study area, and used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to collect aerial photographs along the degradation gradient from late June to early July 2018. We then classified the surface landscape as alpine shrub, alpine meadow, bare soil and plateau pika hole and analyzed the landscape pattern changes at different degradation levels. The results showed that the alpine shrub and alpine meadow dominated landscape degraded to a pattern of alpine meadow and bare soil dominance and pika hole pervasiveness, during which vegetation cover declined and the overall landscape pattern tended to fragment. Landscape pattern characteristics related to the area, density, connectivity and boundaries respond more clearly to the shrub degradation, with moderate degradation being the key stage at which the surface landscape pattern changes dramatically. Our study demonstrates a potential application of UAV technology in the study of grassland degradation. Future research should focus on the status, mechanisms and ecological effects of alpine shrub meadows degradation and the quantitative relationships between surface landscape patterns and ecological functions.

AB  - Forest fragmentation is a significant issue in China; however, a comprehensive understanding and assessment of the temporal trends and spatial modes of forest fragmentation remain lacking. For the first time, this study employs an object-based morphological image processing method to conduct multiscale spatiotemporal identification and analysis of China’s forest landscape from 1985 to 2023. Observations reveal an overall improvement in the integrity of China’s forest landscape from 1985 to 2023, with 79 % of counties showing a positive trend in forest landscape integrity and 5 % experiencing forest fragmentation. The forest core area in China has almost tripled from 1985 to 2023, expanding from 0.57 to 1.53 million km2. Nevertheless, 32.04 % of forests in China remain within 100 m of a non-forest edge, significantly higher than the global average (∼20 %). From 1985 to 2023, out of the 0.33 million km2 of newly planted forests, 29.5 % became forest cores, while the remaining 70.5 % constituted forest edges. This underscores the need for government planning to focus not only on expanding forest areas but also on enhancing the integrity of forest landscapes, thereby creating more ecologically valuable forest ecosystems. Analysis indicates that 25 % of forest fragmentation in China is associated with agriculture (16 %) and urbanization (9 %), while the remaining portion is linked to local topography, climate, and other natural boundaries for forest distribution. Although natural boundaries play a predominant role in forest fragmentation, there is a growing trend of agricultural activities and urbanization encroaching upon the edges. It is recommended that government policies prioritize strategic planning for forest landscape integrity, considering both quantitative expansion and qualitative optimization, to ensure the sustainable development of China’s forest ecosystems.

This paper aims to inspire new research pathways to advance the Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) perspective by focusing on terraced agroecosystems as emblematic landscapes that exemplify this co-production. Informed by recent studies in sustainability science, and drawing on our experience in Mediterranean environments, we explore the transformative potential of these frameworks for understanding and managing terraced landscapes. Addressing their multifunctionality, the challenges they face, and their socio-cultural and ecological significance, we highlight the importance of bridging scientific insights with local knowledge and participatory practices. We examine the use of advanced biophysical assessments, mapping tools, and stakeholder-driven approaches to enhance field assessment, monitoring capabilities and tackle management challenges under changing socio-economic conditions. We stress the urgent need for education and capacity-building initiatives to counteract indigenous knowledge loss and sustain traditional practices. Looking to the future, we propose potential avenues for research and practice that integrate ecological, cultural, and governance dimensions, contributing to the long-term sustainability of terraced landscapes and informing broader efforts for sustainable land management in an era of rapid environmental change.

AB  - Enviromics refers to the characterization of micro- and macroenvironments based on large-scale environmental datasets. By providing genotypic recommendations with predictive extrapolation at a site-specific level, enviromics could inform plant breeding decisions across varying conditions and anticipate productivity in a changing climate. Enviromics-based integration of statistics, envirotyping (i.e., determining environmental factors), and remote sensing could help unravel the complex interplay of genetics, environment, and management. To support this goal, exhaustive envirotyping to generate precise environmental profiles would significantly improve predictions of genotype performance and genetic gain in crops. Already, informatics management platforms aggregate diverse environmental datasets obtained using optical, thermal, radar, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR)sensors that capture detailed information about vegetation, surface structure, and terrain. This wealth of information, coupled with freely available climate data, fuels innovative enviromics research. While enviromics holds immense potential for breeding, a few obstacles remain, such as the need for (1) integrative methodologies to systematically collect field data to scale and expand observations across the landscape with satellite data; (2) state-of-the-art AI models for data integration, simulation, and prediction; (3) cyberinfrastructure for processing big data across scales and providing seamless interfaces to deliver forecasts to stakeholders; and (4) collaboration and data sharing among farmers, breeders, physiologists, geoinformatics experts, and programmers across research institutions. Overcoming these challenges is essential for leveraging the full potential of big data captured by satellites to transform 21st century agriculture and crop improvement through enviromics.

AB  - Wetland is the core functional system of the global alpine region. However, with the development of the social economy in the past few decades, the alpine wetland ecosystem has suffered serious shrinkage, drying, degradation and landscape fragmentation. The decoupling of alpine development from the degradation of wetland ecosystem under global ecological protection would be an important basis for the future planning of regional sustainable development. However, little information is available on how this can be achieved. To fill this gap, we selected Maqu County, a typical alpine wetland region in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China, to analyze the relationship between regional development and wetland ecosystem change in the past 35 years. We examined land use change, landscape pattern, socio-economic development, and a decoupling model. The results revealed that the region underwent a transformation characterized mainly by the conversion of “peatlands to marsh meadows to alpine grasslands.” Peatland decreased by 31.7 %, while desertified lands increased by 78.6 %. Fragmentation of the landscape and wetlands was alleviated during the period from 2000 to 2005; however, the overall trend of fragmentation remained pronounced. A fluctuating decoupling relationship between regional development and landscape fragmentation emerged. Livestock numbers exerted negative effects on landscape stability, especially on wetlands, which indicates that regions reliant on wetland grazing ecosystems for livelihoods are particularly sensitive to grazing activities. We propose a “water-grass-livestock balance” policy centered around water resources that emphasizes the importance of wetland water resource management.

AB  - An interdisciplinary study of the geologic and archaeological records of a 50 ky year period at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary in Olduvai Basin (Tanzania) revealed that a small groundwater-fed wetland was a consistent focus of hominin activity during periods of climate change (wet/dry cycles). Paleoenvironmental analysis of sedimentary records from 33 excavations in Lowermost Bed II (LMB II), Olduvai Gorge (3° S) revealed evidence of significant climate fluctuations that produced two and one half lake cycles between ~1.79 and 1.74 Ma. The region experienced wet-dry cycles in response to combined astronomical forcing effects of eccentricity (~100 ky cycle) and precession of the equinox (19 and 23 ky cycles). Rhythmic variability of the monsoon system produced wet periods followed by a transition into dry periods followed by a transition back into wet climate. A high-resolution study of the stratigraphy documented a groundwater-fed wetland complex (~1 km2) that flourished during low lake levels (dry periods) and was drowned during high lake levels (wet periods). Stratigraphic analysis (temporal changes) of 916 artifacts from 13 excavations selected from a landscape transect across alluvial fan, spring/wetland and lake margin environments showed no notable differences in artifact type frequency and raw material type when comparing wet periods (as a group) and dry periods (as a group). However, a lateral shift of hominin activity on the landscape did occur between wet and dry periods. The Oldowan tool kit did not vary at spring sites between wet and dry periods, whereas the tool kit did vary at other lake margin sites between wet and dry periods. Both analyses suggest that climate affected the location of an activity, not type of activity. These data suggest that Oldowan hominins adapted their land-use patterns to exploit spring/wetland resources available during dry periods. A switch from wet to dry conditions likely altered surface and groundwater systems affecting food and potable water availability, forcing hominins to adjust their subsistence patterns.

AB  - Geomorphological changes have had numerous environmental impacts on landscape features, natural resources, landform stability, and ecosystem services on Bhasan Char Island in the Northern Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh. Therefore, the present study examines the morphological change of the island and its impacts on landscape features, landform stability, and coastal mangrove forest resources since its evolution. Optical satellite images from Landsat (TM and OLI) spanning from 2003 to 2023 have been used to assess geomorphological parameters using the bio-physical indices NDWI and MNDWI. A hybrid classification method involving unsupervised classification, supervised machine learning, and post-classification refinement was employed to precisely delineate landscape features and evaluate ecosystem services. Indeed, to evaluate forest cover health dynamics, the leaf area index (LAI) was estimated using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The study results reveal that the geomorphology of the island was changed by fluvial and marine processes and responses, whereas only 3% of the landscape ages older than 19 years. Results also disclosed that built-up area construction for Rohingya nations drastically lost ∼ 7% of mangrove plantations over the last 8 years, from 2015 to 2023. The current research delivers crucial management strategies regarding further structural development by evading unplanned construction, hastening reforestation, and evolving the green belt along the existing embankment. The study findings will help policymakers, environmental managers, coastal and marine resource planners, ecologists, and geomorphologists take an eco-friendly sustainable development plan and conserve the coastal island and its landscape resources from the risk of fluvial and marine processes.

AB  - Landscape appearance is controlled by a range of different environmental and human-induced factors, although there is still a lack of knowledge about the significance of individual factors. Our goal was to identify the factors that were significant for landscape change in the European Alps and to rank them according to their importance. Therefore, we mapped landscape change with a standardized survey methodology in six typical socio-ecological regions with strongly differing socio-economic and natural conditions. The results clearly showed that significant landscape change has taken place in all regions over the last 150–200 years, affecting biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES). In general, the areas used for agriculture have decreased in all regions, particularly the traditionally used forms (−72.7 % to −6.9 %). The greatest decrease took place in the high elevation, agriculturally unfavourable areas (-72.6 % to −41.6 %) and regions with weak economic conditions (−62.9 % to −20.9 %). The forest has spread on a large scale on the abandoned land in economically strong regions but also settlements and monotone and intensively used cultures. As a consequence of the landscape changes, plant species diversity declined, particularly in favourable regions with a good site and economic conditions (−62.7 % to −7.2 %), while it decreased far less in the economically unfavourable regions (−20.1 % to −0.7 %). Regulation & maintenance and cultural ESs have also decreased, whereas provisioning ES generally increased. Our results also showed that the regional framework conditions play a much more important role in landscape development in the European Alps than national frameworks. Higher “green subsidies” reduced the intensification trend in agriculture, but also led to increased abandonment. In addition, the landscape also remained more diverse, biodiversity declined less and many ecosystem services increased. This demonstrates that interpreting historical landscape dynamics and analysing impacts on ecosystem services can be a valuable guide to sustainable decision-making processes.

AB  - The growing demand for sustainable energy sources has driven research into renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. In this context, fusel oil, a byproduct of sugarcane bioethanol production, has emerged as a promising candidate due to its chemical composition and energy content. This study presents a systematic literature review of 61 peer-reviewed articles and 92 patent families, following the PRISMA framework, to assess the scientific and technological developments surrounding fusel oil. The reviewed literature revealed three primary application categories: renewable fuels (42 %), high-value-added chemical products (35 %), and sustainability-focused waste valorization (23 %). Bibliometric analysis highlighted “bioethanol,” “alternative fuel,” and “distillation” as predominant research themes. Patent analysis revealed a concentration of innovations in catalytic processes, separation technologies, and engine performance optimization. Leading assignees include Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC and Gevo Inc., both of which focus on technologies for producing isobutanol and other bio-based fuels. The most-cited patents address key advancements in fusel oil purification, thermal cracking, and fuel formulation. However, barriers such as high processing costs, lack of regulatory frameworks, and limited industrial integration persist. The findings reinforce fusel oil’s potential as a renewable energy source and industrial input, aligned with circular economy principles. This review offers a consolidated view of current research, highlights gaps in technological adoption, and proposes directions for future interdisciplinary studies to enable broader application of fusel oil in a sustainable bioeconomy.

AB  - Forests, which harbor most of Earth's terrestrial biodiversity, have been and continue to be impacted by significant threats from human activities. Improving biodiversity conservation outcomes requires proactive and effective management actions to address the increasing risks, rather than merely maintaining forest cover. However, few studies have explored how to spatially inform diversified management actions by incorporating risk information into forest protection and restoration planning. Here, we propose an integrated framework for planning forest protection and restoration that integrates landscape resilience and habitat risk assessment, aiming to identify priority areas for diversified management actions, including active protection (AP), passive protection (PP), active restoration (AR), and passive restoration (PR). This framework consists of three key steps: i) evaluating landscape resilience based on forest amount and functional connectivity, ii) assessing habitat risk using the InVEST model, and iii) identifying priority areas and corresponding management actions by spatial overlap analysis between landscape resilience and habitat risk. Using the central region of the Wuhan Metropolitan Area as a case study, we divided it into 3307 planning units, referred to as Focal Landscapes (FLs). The results indicate that there are 636 FLs in the AP zone, 498 in the PP zone, 508 in the AR zone, and 13 in the PR zone. This research demonstrates how effectively integrating risk considerations can enhance the planning process and outcomes. This study also underscores the potential to improve the outcome and cost-effectiveness of biodiversity conservation through the formulation of differentiated management actions and comprehensive planning for protection and restoration.

AB  - Wildfire has been an important force in shaping biological diversity in forests of western North America. Patterns of reburning helped to maintain heterogenous landscapes with low tree densities that naturally limited the extent of severe stand-replacing fires. However, anthropogenic impacts over the past two centuries have dramatically altered fire activity and its ecological function, creating conditions that promote large and intense fires with no historical analog. Fuels reduction treatments represent proven methods to mitigate extreme fire events, but there is controversy over their potential effects to sensitive wildlife species. The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is a forest species that evolved under a frequent-fire regime. Controversy over how spotted owls may be impacted by fuels reduction is one of numerous contributing factors that has limited the pace and scale of implementation. To examine the relationships between spotted owls and fuels reduction treatments, we studied breeding season nocturnal foraging habitat selection related to fuel structural metrics of 159 GPS-tagged California spotted owls across the Sierra Nevada bioregion. Spotted owls selected for higher canopy base height, lower ladder fuel density, and lower canopy bulk density, which represent synergies between fuels reduction treatments and owl space use. Spotted owls also selected for higher surface fuels and higher canopy layer counts, representing potential trade-offs between fuels reduction goals and spotted owl space use. We overlaid the probability of space use by foraging spotted owls with relative stand density index (SDI), a measure of forest resilience, to classify Sierra Nevada landscapes into four groups: low management priority (low owl use/high forest resilience), fuels reduction priority (low owl use/low forest resilience), potential conflict zones (high owl use/low forest resilience), and habitat retention priority (high owl use/high forest resilience). Fuels reduction priority (34.4%) was the largest category, suggesting that potential impacts of fuels reduction on spotted owl foraging habitat may be less widespread in the Sierra Nevada than previously believed. Our results suggest that fuels reduction treatments, especially those focused on mutually beneficial goals such as increasing canopy base height, reducing ladder fuels, and reducing canopy bulk density may directly improve spotted owl foraging habitat while also mitigating the effects of large and severe wildfires on forest species and forest ecosystems.

AB  - Little is known about soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in permafrost-affected soils in Greenland. Generally, occurrence and stocks of SOC in permafrost-affected soils of the Arctic were underestimated for many years. Compared to the assumed dimension of the influence of carbon dynamics on climate change this knowledge should be substantially widened. A total of 155 soil samples were used to get a better understanding about SOC stocks, depth function and spatial distribution of SOC in permafrost-affected soils in a characteristic deglaciated valley in West Greenland southeast of Kangerlussuaq. The valley is characterized by a high variability of active layer thickness and pedo-variance mainly caused by topography. The average SOC stock of the Umimmalissuaq valley is 9.9kgm−2 in the upper 30cm and around 30kgm−2 in the first meter, which is remarkably higher than regional predictions with 6–15.9kgm−2 in the first 100cm. To account for spatial heterogeneity landscape units are developed which are most useful for grouping and predicting SOC stocks. The SOC store measured 14.2kgm−2 in the upper 30cm, 11.5kgm−2 on north-facing slopes, and 8.4kgm−2 on south-facing slopes. Little SOC stocks with around 6kgm−2 were found under abrasion fields particularly on hilltops and moraine ridges. Soils on south-facing slopes usually have very low SOC stocks in deeper soil horizons except of organic rich horizons in rarely occurring paleosols. North-facing soils and valley bottom slopes generally have high SOC stocks of around 19kg SOC m−2 in soil horizons with a depth of 30–100cm. In general, the main influencing parameter on SOC stocks is the soil organic matter input from the vegetative cover. The vegetative cover is mainly a result of topographic position and aspect related to the ice margin and katabatic winds. Soil moisture and high active layer may influence SOC stocks positively.

AB  - Identifying important habitats in the bay area is essential for constructing a land–sea blue-green ecological network. Here, we focused on Luoyuan Bay on the west coast of Taiwan Strait and the southeast coast of China and characterized the spatial distribution of production, living, and ecological space based on the ecological functions of each land use type in the bay area. We then identified ecological source areas and important habitats. Finally, we analyzed the ecological corridors and key nodes, constructed a “blue-green” ecological network that combines “point-line-plane” in the sea and land areas, and make strategies to optimize the network. The results of the study indicated that: (1) The production, living, and ecological spaces of Luoyuan Bay Area were significantly differentiated. Seven combinations of land use functions were examined, and single function-dominated space was predominant; the ecological function-dominated space accounted for 77.79% of the entire study area. (2) Most of the ecological source sites were distributed in the peripheral and central waters of the study area, and the first and second-level ecological source sites accounted for 75.72% and 8%, respectively. The spatial distribution of important habitats was generally homogeneous, but some parts in the land–sea interface area have more fragmented habitat patches and less connectivity. (3) There were 20 ecological corridors connecting land and sea and 27 key ecological nodes in Luoyuan Bay; most of the key ecological nodes are distributed in these corridors. (4) Important habitats in the Bay Area comprised key ecological nodes, such as ecological corridors connecting land and sea with ecological pinch points and ecological obstacle points. The “point-line-plane” optimization principle can facilitate the scientifically based construction of a blue-green ecological network pattern connecting the sea and land in the Bay Area. (5) Strategies such as project construction and policy development and implementation across regions will maximize the effectiveness of ecological network construction and optimization in the Bay Area. This can enhance the ecological security pattern and promote ecological circulation of the land–sea interface. Overall, our findings provide key information that will aid the construction of the ecological security pattern, as well as the planning of ecological protection and restoration measures that could be implemented in the land–sea interface of the Bay Area.

AB  - Ecological systems are spatially heterogeneous on a wide range of scales. Landscapes usually refer to broad geographic areas that comprise multiple ecosystems or land use/land cover types, which are human-environmental systems with varying degrees of anthropogenic dominance. Landscape ecology is the science of studying and improving the relationship between spatial pattern and ecological processes across scales and organizational levels. In a broad sense, landscape ecology represents both a field of study and a new ecological paradigm. As a highly interdisciplinary research field, landscape ecology integrates biophysical and analytical approaches with humanistic and holistic perspectives across natural and social sciences. As a scientific paradigm, landscape ecology is characterized by its explicit emphasis on the causes, processes, and ecological consequences of spatial heterogeneity on multiple scales. Thus, the relationship between pattern, process and scale has been a dominant theme of landscape ecological studies since the 1980s. Ecological flows in landscape mosaics, land use and land cover change, scaling, relating landscape pattern analysis with ecological processes, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and landscape sustainability are among the key research topics in modern landscape ecology. During the past several decades, the landscape ecology perspective has become pervasive in almost all areas of ecology, and increasingly important to biodiversity conservation, landscape and urban planning, and sustainability research and practice.

AB  - Wetlands play an important role in ecological health and sustainable development, and dynamic monitoring of their spatial distribution is crucial for developing management and conservation measures. The types of coastal wetlands are complex and diverse, natural and artificial wetlands are easily confused, making precise classification more difficult. The coastal wetland of Chongming Island in China, which has diverse types and unique and complex ecological and hydrological characteristics, was deliberately chosen as a challenging case study. The objective of this study was to research effective method of fine classification of coastal wetlands, by constructing feature variables and proposing strategies for multi-level selection and fusion of feature variables. Sentinel-2 data with rich spectral information and high spatial resolution was be used. In this study, firstly, the classification effect of characteristic variables such as vegetation index, water body index, red edge index, and texture index were evaluated. Focusing on the “different objects with same spectra” of the humid planning land and farm growing ponds, the spectral characteristics of them were analyzed and a “water-rich soil index (WRSI)” was established. Subsequently, correlation analysis and J-M distance method were used to multi-level selection for the feature variables and four sets of features combination schemes were established. Finally, random forest (RF) was applied to classify coastal wetlands using different feature combination schemes, and the accuracy of different schemes was compared and verified. The results show the following: 1)Texture features have a promoting effect on improving classification accuracy. The constructed “water rich soil index”(WRSI) has the effectively contribution to identification and classification of farm growing ponds and humid planned land, improving the overall classification accuracy by 6.52%. 2)By multi-level selecting and fusion of feature variable sets, both accuracy and efficiency for classification are improved. For different features combination schemes, the classification accuracy is up to 90.03% by integrating spectral features, spectral index, texture index, and WRSI. This study evaluates the potential of Sentinel-2 data in coastal wetland classification, constructs effective feature parameters, and provides a new idea for wetland information extraction. The resulting classification map can be used for sustainable management, ecological assessment and conservation of the coastal wetland.

AB  - Many mangrove forests located along estuaries and deltas worldwide are currently facing irreparable losses caused by natural factors and intensive anthropogenic disturbances. The limited capabilities of traditional remote sensing processing platforms tend to lead to poor image processing consistency in medium- and large-scale areas, resulting in lower ground object classification accuracy. Consequently, little information is available regarding the extent and causes of variation in large-scale mangrove forests. In this study, we used Google Earth Engine mangrove forest data from eight periods between 1985 and 2020, with total accuracy rates of 82.95–90.15%, and combined landscape metrics with a centroid transfer model to quantitatively analyze the landscape evolution of mangrove forests in China. Finally, we employed a geodetector based on optimized parameters to quantitatively determine the potential mechanisms driving mangrove landscape evolution. Overall, a slight increase followed by a sharp decrease in mangrove forest area in China during the past 40 years, with a turning point around 2000 and substantial shifts in mangrove spatial patterns in Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces, particularly in the Pearl River Estuary and Beibu Gulf. The landscape pattern of Chinese mangrove forests has become fragmented and isolated through rapid urbanization in recent decades. Mangrove forests shifted significantly (> 31 km) early in the study period, followed by smaller shifts later in the study period. The optimal spatial scale of mangrove landscape driver detection was 270 m × 270 m. The variation in mangrove forest area was caused by the interactions of multiple factors, particularly between mean annual precipitation and other potential influencing factors. Government policies guided the conservation and management of mangrove forests in China to varying degrees throughout the study period. Our findings on the dynamics of mangrove forests provide a reference for integrated coastal management, which will contribute to the ecological utilization and high-quality development of coasts during extensive urbanization along the southeastern coast of China and similar large estuary deltas worldwide.

AB  - Arctic permafrost is degrading and is thus releasing nutrients, solutes, sediment and water into soils and freshwater ecosystems. The impacts of this degradation depends on the geochemical characteristics and in large part on the spatial distribution of ground ice and solutes, which is not well-known in the High Arctic polar desert ecosystems. This research links ground ice and solute concentrations, to establish a framework for identifying locations vulnerable to permafrost degradation. It builds on landscape classifications and cryostratigraphic interpretations of permafrost history. Well-vegetated wetland sites with syngenetic permafrost aggradation show a different geochemical signature from polar desert and epigenetic sites. In wetlands, where ground ice contents were high (<97% volume), total dissolved solute concentrations were relatively low (mean 283.0 ± 327.8 ppm), reflecting a carbonate terrestrial/freshwater setting. In drier sites with epigenetic origin, such as polar deserts, ice contents are low (<47% volume), solute concentrations were high (mean 3248.5 ± 1907.0 ppm, max 12055 ppm) and dominated by Na+ and Cl− ions, reflecting a post-glacial marine inundation during permafrost formation. Dissolved organic carbon and total dissolved nitrogen concentrations usually increased at the top of permafrost and could not be as clearly associated with permafrost history. The research shows that the geochemistry of polar desert permafrost is highly dependent on permafrost history, and it can be estimated using hydrogeomorphological terrain classifications. The lower ice content of polar desert sites indicates that these areas are more vulnerable to thaw relative to the ice-rich wetland sites, and the elevated solute concentrations indicate that these areas could mobilise substantial solutes to downstream environments, should they become hydrologically connected with future warming.
La dégradation continue du pergélisol depuis quelques décennies engendre une libération d'eau, de nutriments et de solides dessous vers les sols et les écosystèmes aquatiques. La compréhension et la prédiction des effets de cette dégradation nécessite l'identification de la variation spatiale des distributions de solides dissous et de la glace de sol, une opération peu convenue dans le Haut Arctique et les écosystèmes de déserts polaires. Cette recherche vient tisser les liens entre la présence de la glace de sol et le contenu des solutions de sol, afin d’établir un modèle permettant d'identifier les zones subissant des effets importants de la dégradation du pergélisol. Elle se base sur une classification hydro-géomorphologique du paysage et sur l'interprétation cryostratigraphique de l'histoire du pergélisol. Les milieux humides bien végétalisés ayant subi une aggradation syngénétique du pergélisol démontrent une signature géochimique contrasté face aux sites secs de désert polaires et de pergélisol épigénétique. Dans les milieux humides syngénétiques, les concentrations en solides dissous demeurent relativement faibles (moyenne de 283,0 ± 327,8 ppm), typique d'environnements carbonatés, ainsi que des teneurs en glace élevées (<97% du volume). Les sites plus secs à l'origine épigénétique, comme les déserts polaires, possédaient des teneurs en glace de sol plus faibles (<47% du volume) étaient dominés par des volumes élevés de solides dissous (jusqu’à 12055 ppm) et une signature saline (Na+ et Cl−) démontrant une aggradation du pergélisol synchrone à la transgression marine post-glaciaire de l'Holocène inférieur. La concentration en carbone dissous et en azote total est habituellement plus élevée au sommet du pergélisol, présentant une forte variabilité à travers les environnements, tout en étant plus difficilement attribuable à l'historique du pergélisol. La recherche démontre que la géochimie du pergélisol dans les déserts polaires dépend fortement de l'historique du pergélisol, et que la classification hydro-géomorphologique peut permettre de généraliser ses caractéristiques.

AB  - Studies on urban climate are important to this rapidly urbanizing world as they play a role in monitoring the quality of life in urban areas. Urban meteorological networks (UMNs) have thus emerged in recent decades to collect data for urban climate research worldwide. Government involvement in an UMN project is beneficial to standardizing network configurations, maintaining stations durability, striking a balance between stakeholders from various disciplines, and the implementation of future climate-related policies. This review draws upon a total of 33 government-involved projects, examining their project objectives and outcomes, UMN configurations, and management methods. There are two common network types: single-sourced UMNs which are deployed more systematically, and crowdsourced UMNs which can be managed in a more cost-efficient manner while promoting citizen science. A major advantage of UMNs over conventional regional meteorological networks is its high-density setting that can increase spatial resolution of weather observations within the city. However, most UMNs are still at an experimental stage, and have room for improvement in data quality and robustness. Nevertheless, the reviewed projects demonstrated their importance in improving the understanding of urban microclimates, weather services, and cross-disciplinary research. To facilitate further advancement in the field of urban climate research, more comprehensive yet locally-adaptable guidelines are recommended regarding UMN setup, management, data quality check and interpretation. Governments are encouraged to continue taking the lead in collaborating with local communities and other cities, so that the full potential of UMNs in enhancing urban living quality and formulating future climate-related policies can be unleashed.

AB  - As a unique land-sea transitional wetland, mangroves possess high ecosystem service value. Monitoring mangroves in cross-border areas is crucial for shaping bilateral protection policies and guiding effective management decisions. This study examines the spatio-temporal dynamics of mangroves in the Beibu Gulf, situated in the China-Vietnam cross-border region, utilizing long-term Landsat imagery and an object-oriented deep learning classification technique from 1991 to 2021. Combining land cover change, landscape indices, and spatial analysis, the spatio-temporal dynamics of mangroves were quantitatively evaluated. Results reveal that the object-oriented deep learning classification method significantly enhances mapping accuracy and integrality of the classification results. During 1991−2021, the mangrove area in the Beibu Gulf coastal zone (BGCZ) increased by 92.11 km2, with annual increases of 0.82 km2 in the China part and 2.25 km2 in the Vietnam part. Mangroves connectivity improved in both the China and Vietnam parts, though the degree of disturbance was more pronounced in the Vietnam part compared to the China part. Mangrove dynamics are influenced by numerous factors, with aquaculture being the primary cause of mangrove fragmentation in the BGCZ. Varied management mechanisms and coastal zone development models in China and Vietnam have exerted influence on the dynamic evolution of mangroves. This study offers a significant scientific foundation for future cross-border mangrove conservation and management.

AB  - Mangroves are high-productive ecosystems and globally protected. Establishing nature reserves aimed at counteracting the negative effects of anthropogenic activities is one of the most pivotal approaches to conserve mangrove ecosystems. Evaluation of the conservation effectiveness for mangrove nature reserves is thus indispensable for making knowledge-based conservation policies and funding-decisions by government and managers. In this study, using composited Landsat images by the Google Earth Engine cloud platform and object-oriented deep learning classification method, the land cover maps of national mangrove nature reserves (NMNRs) in China were obtained from 1987 to 2019. The systematic evaluation of conservation effectiveness for each NMNR was conducted by landscape metrics and an entropy weight model. Combined with the dynamics in mangrove distribution, human interference intensity, and natural environment change, the driving force factors affecting the conservation effectiveness for NMNRs were investigated. The results show that the total mangrove area in all NMNRs increased 968.6 ha during the study period, a 21.8 % rate of increase. Except for one NMNR with a slight decline, the conservation of remaining NMNRs was considered effective with increase varied from 14.8 % to 87.5 % in the level of protective efficacy. The conservation effectiveness of NMNRs was affected by both anthropogenic and natural factors, while the improvement to the conservation effectiveness was largely attributed to the implementation of protection policies, such as reforestation engineering. Further direct or indirect challenges in mangrove conservation effectiveness, e.g., pollution, natural disasters, and exotic species invasion, still require close attention. This study provides an effective and efficient approach to quantify the conservation effectiveness of mangrove nature reserves, which would facilitate mangrove conservation and management in the future.

AB  - Landslides are widely understood to cause damage to the geological features and the surrounding environment. Our study focuses on the northern region of the Karangsambung-Karangbolong Geopark (KKNG), characterized by diverse lithology and multi-phase tectonics. This study aims to explore (i) landslide susceptibility assessment, (ii) geomorphological characteristics and distribution of landslide susceptibility, and (iii) identification of landslide impacts on geosites. We mapped morphogenesis, morphology, materials, and processes to understand the geomorphological context, identifying three primary landforms: structural, pediments, and fluvial. For landslide susceptibility mapping, we used the XGBoost algorithm with cross-validation and utilized the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for model validation. The XGBoost model revealed a high susceptibility classification for 10 geosite points. Landslides have negative impacts, such as Olistoliths of coral limestones, Exotic-blocks of chert, and calcareous red claystone that change landforms and damage outcrops. Nevertheless, some landslides have positive impacts on the geosite, such as Exotic-blocks of phyllites, and Exotic-blocks of pillow lava and radiolarian chert, because landslides can reveal fresher outcrops and rock structures, and the outcrop area becomes larger. Landslide mapping has successfully identified geosites that are highly vulnerable and have adverse impacts, especially those with certain lithological characteristics. This research on viewing disaster as a harmful process has evolved into a more holistic view of the disaster. This view includes various positive aspects that involve understanding the complex interactions between geology and geomorphology towards the geosite. By understanding the relationship between geomorphologic features (morphology, material, process, morpho-arrangement) and landslide occurrence, effective management strategies can be implemented to develop geological heritage further.

AB  - This comprehensive review examines the evolution of biocomposites in renewable energy applications from 2004 to 2024, analyzing their development through research trends, technological maturation, and market implementation. Through systematic analysis of 694 academic publications and 122 patents, distinct developmental phases and innovation patterns were identified. The findings reveal substantial growth in biocomposite applications across renewable energy sectors, with publication rates increasing by 285 % since 2015 and patent filings showing a parallel 175 % increase. The United States emerges as a key jurisdiction for both research output (96 publications, 13.8 %) and patent protection (35 patents, 28.7 %), while demonstrating strong international collaboration networks averaging 4.75 authors per publication. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) analysis reveals mature development in energy storage applications (TRL 7-8, 72 % implementation rate), which represent 45 % of patent filings. Key technological trends include advanced energy storage solutions, particularly in cellulose-based biocomposites (169 implementations), and emerging smart adaptive systems. The biocomposites market shows remarkable expansion potential, projected to reach $80.55 billion by 2029 from $23.9 billion in 2021. This review synthesizes these developments, analyzes commercialization barriers, and provides strategic recommendations for advancing sustainable energy solutions through biocomposite technologies.

By analyzing relevant literature, we identify key trends and challenges, particularly in the use of Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. Our findings highlight RF as the most widely adopted algorithm for ecological classification tasks, while SVMs and DL techniques are particularly effective for handling complex, multimodal datasets and modeling non-linear ecological processes. The study demonstrates how these ML methods are advancing ecological research by improving predictions of environmental change, enhancing ecosystem management, and enabling more accurate simulations of ecological dynamics. We also discuss the integration of ML into ecological science, underscoring its potential to overcome traditional research limitations and open new avenues for understanding complex ecological patterns. This research contributes to the growing body of work on ML applications in ecology, offering insights into both the current state and future directions of the field.

AB  - Renewable energy systems and ecosystem services, both vital for human society, are often at odds. The land cover change brought about by renewable energy expansions tends to degrade ecosystem services. An effective approach for appraising the effects of renewable energy expansions on ecosystem services is therefore urgently needed. Faced with recent acute power shortages, Pakistan has embarked on renewable energy expansions to meet its future energy demands. These expansions, in turn, will degrade ecosystems in the country, leading to a further decline in the value of its already dwindling ecosystem services. To quantify this decline, I combine spatially explicit modeling and ecosystem services valuation techniques to monetize the impacts of the potential expansions of three energy systems: solar, wind, and hydro. The results show that 18.35 % of Pakistan's total area is suitable for potential renewable energy expansion, with 14.83 % of that total appropriate for solar, 3.48 % for wind, and 0.04 % for hydropower. The average value of ecosystem services from the areas of impact by potential expansions of solar, wind, and hydropower energy systems are respectively $2026, $2160, and $2824 per hectare per year (in 2020 U.S. dollars). Furthermore, the permanent loss of ecosystem services from the expansions decreases in the order of hydropower > solar > wind. The renewable energy expansions based on the potential energy mix for the year 2030 will cause a total impact of up to $9617 million per year thereafter, with a complete loss of $1259.4 million per year in ecosystem services values. These results can help achieve a finely balanced trade-off between renewable energy expansions and ecosystem services in the country. This novel approach for assessing the environmental footprints of energy expansions can be a trailblazer for countries and regions aiming at transitioning to renewable energy systems.

AB  - Tourism activities may interfere with the landscape pattern as a type of human activity. Scientific decision-making in the river basin's tourism development requires a precise understanding of the tourism activities' complicated effects on landscape patterns. The research object is to ascertain the direction and magnitude of the influence of tourism activities on the landscape pattern in the Xin'an River Basin. The response index (RI) was calculated by comparing the dynamic characteristics of landscape pattern metrics and Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) inside and outside the 24 scenic areas. The results show the RI (=−2.56) of the scenic areas is eight times higher than that of the other areas, which indicates the intensity of the tourism activities' negative impact on the landscape pattern. Cultural and low-level scenic areas have more serious landscape fragmentation in general, through the comparative analysis of different types and scales of scenic areas. Combined with the analysis of tourism socio-economic data, scenic area construction is the main factor leading to landscape fragmentation. This study is an effective review of the impact of China's tourism industry on landscape patterns in the past 40 years, and the proposed RI will better help to quantify the effect of tourism activities on landscape patterns.

AB  - Indigenous Cultural Mapping (ICM) has the capacity to contribute to sustainably managing Sea Country. While there is a growing community of practice using ICM of marine, island, and coastal areas to incorporate Indigenous knowledge and cultural values into sustainability and conservation efforts, the literature is widely dispersed, and the method is not clearly defined or described. This scoping review evaluates the breadth and depth of practice undertaking ICM in island, coastal, and marine areas as captured within the English language scientific and grey literature. The objectives of this review were: 1) to determine the extent to which ICM is used a tool to manage Sea Country; 2) to evaluate the methods used throughout the process of ICM; and 3) to assess the studies against Arnstein’s (1969) ladder of participation. We used the Population Concept Context framework, searched Scopus, Web of Science, and Informit databases and Google Scholar, and identified studies that mapped Indigenous culture and/or cultural values in Sea Country. We included 54 studies that used ICM methods and were focused on Sea Country. These studies contribute to a growing body of work that demonstrates the value Indigenous knowledge adds to the sustainability of Sea Country now and into the future. High-level power-sharing and partnership throughout the research process is critically important. However, a lack of consistent standards of practice perpetuates research practices that exclude Indigenous communities from the research cycle. This limits the ability of ICM to improve sustainable practices that conserve and protect Sea Country.

AB  - Projects demanding deforestation to expand urban infrastructure and road networks put pressure on the Atlantic Forest − a hyper-fragmented global conservation hotspot known for its high biodiversity and endemism. To support decision-making, we applied a scientific approach to analyse the immediate and long-term impacts of two major planned projects in the most threatened Atlantic Forest region – the Pernambuco Endemism Center, a crucial area for the survival of many endemic species. A Metropolitan Road Arch and a Training School for Career Sergeants are expected in the Environmental Protection Area Aldeia-Beberibe (31,634 ha) in the next few years. The area has 198 protected forest remnants, including one larger than 10,000 ha. Our analysis shows that the projects’ implementation may deforest 189 ha, increase fragment number by 3.5 % and decrease the average patch area by 4 %. The largest fragment will be divided into two. We may lose 335,307 trees and 44,655.59 Mg of carbon. Approximately 112.67 ha of watershed protection will be damaged. Thus, in the medium to long term, habitat quality will worsen, and the probability of connectivity will decrease, restricting forest-dependent species’ mobility considerably. To date, alternative areas have been proposed in meetings, working groups, and environmental advisory bodies for the analysed projects.We strongly oppose further deforestation and suggest that science-based approaches must be immediately considered for any project that requires forest suppression in highly fragmented landscapes. This is crucial to mitigate the alarming scenarios of extreme climate and biodiversity loss that we are currently witnessing in Brazil and worldwide.

AB  - Ecological security is a critical guarantor of human security and indeed human survival and is closely associated with sustainable development. Yet exploration of ecological security assessment in alpine pastoral regions is lacking, and many studies have failed to perform validation analyses on ecological security assessment results, weakening the reliability of their assessment results. In this study, an ecosystem health-risk-services framework is developed to assess the ecological security of the Gannan alpine pastoral region (GAPR) on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau from 2000 to 2020. Then, the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) and high-resolution images are then introduced to verify and compare the results’ reliability. Our study results indicate: (1) The assessment framework can better reflect the actual ecological security state in GAPR, and the correlation coefficient (R2) of the comprehensive ecological security index (CESI) and RSEI is between 0.426 and 0.555 (p < 0.001). (2) The CESI value of GAPR shows a fluctuating and increasing trend from 2000 to 2020, with a spatial distribution pattern of high values in the south and low values in the north. The ecological security levels in GAPR are dominated by medium, medium-high and high security levels. (3) The centers of gravity of low and medium-low security levels show a northward movement trend, while that of medium-high and high security levels show a southward movement. Our framework provides a new perspective for ecological security assessment methods, which can be extended to other regions, and the results contribute useful references to decision-makers for socioeconomic development and eco-environmental protection in GAPR.

AB  - We mapped submarine canyon research using a scientometric approach to define and characterize its scientific landscape based on a comprehensive bibliographic dataset. The abundance of studies covering structural and functional aspects of submarine canyons allowed us to identify the existing knowledge clusters, historical trends, and emergent topics in canyon research. Our analysis documented a network of knowledge clusters of which four were particularly relevant: a strong cluster on “Geology & Geophysics”, well established since the beginnings of canyon research; a cluster on “Biology & Ecology” that gained strength primarily over the past two to three decades; a cluster on “Oceanographic Processes” which occupied a central position in the network and connected strongly to almost all the other clusters and especially to the fourth main cluster on “Modelling”. A smaller, but also well connected, cluster on “Biogeochemistry” related closely to “Biology & Ecology”, and three other small clusters (“Sedimentology”, “Sediments & Tidal Currents”, “Canyon Sampling”) bridged the main clusters. Finally, we identified three small, but specific satellite clusters (“Oil & Gas”, “Chemosynthetic Communities”, “Molecular & Symbionts”). The high-level structure of the knowledge network reflects a latent interdisciplinarity in canyon research. However, the evolution of the research lines over the past nine decades suggests that this pattern arose mostly in the new millennium. Emergent research topics in the last decade also reveal a concern regarding anthropogenic impacts and climate-driven processes. Our results also show a well implemented and international collaboration network, although research efforts have been mainly directed towards only a few canyon systems. A geographical and thematic bias also characterizes canyon research, with specific topics addressed preferentially in particular canyons by different leading research institutions. This spatial and thematic bias, together with the paucity of truly inter-disciplinary studies, may be the most important limitation to integrated knowledge and development in canyon research and hinders a global, more comprehensive understanding of canyon patterns and processes. The scientific landscape mapping and the complementary results are made available as an open and interactive platform that canyon stakeholders can use as a tool to identify knowledge gaps, to find key players in the global collaboration network and to facilitate planning of future research in submarine canyons.

AB  - Land use change in rural areas often result from the decision-making of individual farming households. It is a complex process that operates at different temporal and spatial scales through the interactions between diverse drivers. Main drivers of wetland conversion for agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and those influencing its land use change have been explored in the past. But often the factors have not been explicitly considered in these studies. Tools and concepts that consider the decision-making processes of farmers have become common approaches used in studies to understand and explore changes in land use. This paper describes an empirical model framework to analyse land development and use processes as a result of individual farmer’s decision-making in small wetlands in SSA. The model framework uses information on the drivers of land use change, landscape classification, and household typologies. Processes of land conversion, as well as of probabilistic and heuristic decision-making were integrated in the framework. The model framework was applied to a case study on a sub-humid lowland floodplain in Tanzania, where land conversion, fallow, and use change processes are shaping the structure of the wetland. The scenario of increasing land scarcity on upland was simulated to explore how defined processes will respond to the rising pressure exerted on the wetland. Land conversion increased by 10 percent, fallow practices decreased by one-third to half. Wetland fields were defragmented due to increasing demand for crop production in the wetland. Shifts in relative distributions of farm types were simulated within and between wetland cluster groups, where all upland dependent crop-based farmers disappeared. The application revealed the potential of including individual decision-making in understanding the heterogeneity and functioning of such systems. The application possibilities and limitations of the model as well as challenges to model complex interactions in land use systems are discussed. The study raised the need to improve the means by which socio-environmental systems are anticipated and managed in the face of likely or projected changes in demography, economics, and resources at different scales.

AB  - Most local authorities in rural Mexico lack relevant resource data at appropriate scales to develop community plans, even though planning and development decisions are made largely at this level of government. Many resource planning studies have been conducted in less developed areas of Mexico, but these are of limited applicability to economies in rapid transition facing tremendous internal developmental pressure, such as in the state of Jalisco. In order to assist such local rural communities in Mexico achieve a sustainable balance, a landscape planning process which includes community engagement, supplemented with landscape analyses, classification, mapping as well as various qualitative research methods, is described and analyzed. A site analysis across the case municipality of Tapalpa identified major landscape units, and environmental and socio-economic issues, which were grouped into major themes. Following interviews with community members, a participatory workshop charrette was conducted, where local and institutional stakeholders discussed issues uncovered during the interviews and landscape analysis. A final set of sustainable development recommendations and visualizations demonstrating potential outcomes was assembled for legislation and implementation. This study showed that community engagement through the use of participatory landscape planning is an effective means of informing and impacting local policy related to sustainable community development in rural Mexico. Furthermore, it demonstrates the lack of planning in landscapes outside of major population centers, and the limited utility of existing policies which lack appropriate scale and applicability to rural areas.

AB  - While the influence of boreal landscapes on plants has been investigated in the drastically altered landscapes of Europe, we are lacking the knowledge on how the relatively intact landscapes of North America influence local bryophyte communities. Using a patch-landscape approach, we evaluated the effects of landscape composition (considering age and forest type of patches) and configuration (patch density) on bryophyte diversity (richness, common and dominant species) in old forest target patches. The effects of landscape composition and configuration (in 92 landscapes of 10 km radii) were evaluated both for all bryophytes and by guild (mosses, liverworts and Sphagna). The richness of mosses exhibited a negative correlation with the expanding area of young forests in the landscape. Furthermore, liverwort richness and its common species, experienced a significant decline when young forests comprised more than 40% of the landscape area. Response to mixed forest percent area influence differed among guilds, but diversity of liverworts and Sphagna were negatively related to increasing coniferous patch density. Even within the relatively undisturbed boreal forest of North America, young forests have a significant impact on old forest patch diversity. To conserve bryophyte diversity in old forest patches within managed forest regions, we suggest that the young forest area not exceed 40% of the surrounding landscape and that aggregation of these stands is avoided. The species loss thresholds detected here can be used in landscape planning to mitigate the negative effects of land-use change on boreal biodiversity.

AB  - Despite growing recognition of green spaces' role in mitigating urban heat island (UHI) effects, research on how different green space landscape patterns impact land surface temperature (LST) across various spatial scales remains limited, particularly in mountainous cities where human-land conflicts complicate this relationship. This study uses XGBoost-SHAP models to analyze the effects of different green space landscape patterns on LST in major gray-green landscape combinations (artificial green space-impervious surface combination (AGIS), mountain green space-impervious surface combination (MGIS), artificial green space-mountain green space-impervious surface combination (AGMGIS)) in the central urban area of Guiyang City, China, across grid scales of 150 to 600 m. The results show that: (1) At various spatial scales, the MGIS exhibits the lowest average LST, whereas AGIS registers the highest, underscoring the superior cooling efficacy of mountain green spaces over their artificial counterparts. (2) Beyond increasing green space area, enhancing patch connectivity further reduces the LST in mountainous cities. (3) The influence of green space landscape patterns on LST's significant cooling thresholds exhibits a scale-dependent effect. For instance, the cooling thresholds for MGIS's mountain green space proportion range from 70.93 % to 86.27 % across grid scales of 150 to 600 m. Notably, high landscape percentage, large largest patch index, and low landscape division index in mountain green spaces significantly enhance cooling effects of both MGIS and AGMGIS. (4) Increasing patch shape complexity improves cooling in small mountain green spaces, while enhancing connectivity boosts cooling in small artificial green spaces. Overall, in mountainous cities, maximizing the area and integrity of mountain green spaces is essential for optimal cooling. When mountain green space area is constrained, maintaining patch shape complexity is recommended. Meanwhile, when artificial green space area is limited, ensuring patch connectivity is crucial. These strategies enhance cooling effects and provide insights for mitigating UHI in mountainous urban areas.

KW  - European landscape convention
AB  - Landscapes change because they are the expression of the dynamic interaction between natural and cultural forces in the environment. Cultural landscapes are the result of consecutive reorganization of the land in order to adapt its use and spatial structure better to the changing societal demands. Particularly in Europe, history has recorded many successive and even devastating landscape changes, which have left barely any relics today. Today, the changes are seen as a menace, as a negative evolution because they cause a loss of diversity, coherence and identity, which were characteristic for the traditional cultural landscapes that are rapidly vanishing. This growing concern is also expressed in the European Landscape Convention, which will be used as a start for the analysis in this article. Three periods of landscape dynamics are considered: the traditional landscapes before the important changes that started in the 18th century, the landscapes of the revolutions age of the 19th to 20th century, and the post-modern new landscapes. The combined effect of the driving forces such as accessibility, urbanization, globalization and the impact of calamities have been different in each of the periods and affected the nature and pace of the changes as well as the perception people have had about the landscape. Values change accordingly and so does the way of using and shaping the landscape. It is argued that this changing perception also influences what kind and aspects of landscapes are studied, protected and managed. Diversity and identity of cultural landscapes are central in the discussion. It is shown that coherence between small composing elements in a broader spatial context is important for the legibility of the landscape and that the ability to tell the (his)story of a place strongly enhances the identity and the overall value. This offers criteria for inventorying and assessing landscapes, which is needed to define future management and development. Although the general trends of future development of the European landscapes are rather well known, planning and managing future landscape remains difficult and extremely uncertain. The processes and management in past traditional landscapes and the manifold relations people have towards the perceivable environment and the symbolic meaning it generates, offer valuable knowledge for more sustainable planning and management for future landscapes.

This paper introduces a new terrain model named HAND, and reports on the calibration and validation of landscape classes representing soil environments in Amazonia, which were derived using it. The HAND model normalizes topography according to the local relative heights found along the drainage network, and in this way, presents the topology of the relative soil gravitational potentials, or local draining potentials. The HAND model has been demonstrated to show a high correlation with the depth of the water table, providing an accurate spatial representation of soil water environments. Normalized draining potentials can be classified according to the relative vertical flowpath-distances to the nearest drainages, defining classes of soil water environments. These classes have been shown to be comparable and have verifiable and reproducible hydrological significance across the studied catchment and for surrounding ungauged catchments. The robust validation of this model over an area of 18,000km2 in the lower Rio Negro catchment has demonstrated its capacity to map expansive environments using only remotely acquired topography data as inputs. The classified HAND model has also preliminarily demonstrated robustness when applied to ungauged catchments elsewhere with contrasting geologies, geomorphologies and soil types. The HAND model and the derived soil water maps can help to advance physically based hydrological models and be applied to a host of disciplines that focus on soil moisture and ground water dynamics. As an original assessment of soil water in the landscape, the HAND model explores the synergy between digital topography data and terrain modeling, presenting an opportunity for solving many difficult problems in hydrology.

AB  - Accurate mapping for effective management of peat soils is necessary to help reduce GHG emissions and improve environmental quality. However, mapping remains a major challenge as definitions of peat soils vary substantially between jurisdictions and organizations, while field data are sparse and difficult to produce, and remote sensing of limited use for converted peatlands. Using an Adaptive Mapping Framework, this paper compiles disparate data sources to update the Derived Irish Peat Map to better facilitate its application for environmental issues. This includes incorporation of areas considered to be underlain by shallow peat soils (≥ 10 cm and ≥ 8.6 % Organic Matter content), and augmentation of the overall test dataset with an additional ∼ 20,000 points. The workflow for map generation employed 20 Decision Tree Output Maps (DTOMs), aggregated into 33 Map Combinations (MCs). These facilitated the addition of new areas and removal of areas where the presence of peat could not be confidently identified. The MC selected for the update had the highest accuracy metrics (≥ 74 %), consisting of DTOMs with a user accuracy ≥ 66 % and assessed over a minimum number of test points ≥ 50. The resulting map reveals peat to underlie 1.66 M ha of Ireland (∼ 23.3 % of the country), identified with values of 83 % for overall accuracy and F1 score for peat areas. This extent is 13.2 % larger than that delineated in previous versions and at least 23.2 % larger than areas presented in other previous maps. The methodology also allows transparency from which data sources can be distinguished to define different key peat thickness ranges (≥ 10 cm, ≥ 30–40 cm), better facilitating assessment of environmental impacts arising from land use change. This approach has potential relevance for peat mapping globally, notably in areas containing disparate datasets (e.g., land cover, soil map, etc.), or employing different production methods. The accuracy metrics generated also suggest that the approach can be used as a basis for implementing or updating national and international regulations concerning carbon-rich soils in comparable settings to those encountered in Ireland.

AB  - Landscape analysis and ecosystem service assessment have drawn increasing concern from research and application at the landscape scale. Thanks to the continuously emerging assessments as well as studies aiming at evaluation method improvement, policy makers and landscape managers have an increasing interest in integrating ecosystem services into their decisions. However, the plausible assessments carry numerous sources of uncertainties, which regrettably tend to be ignored or disregarded by the actors or researchers. In order to cope with uncertainties and make them more transparent for landscape managers, we demonstrate them by reviewing literature, describing an example and proposing approaches for uncertainty analysis. Additionally, we conclude with potential actions to reduce the insecurities accompanying landscape analysis and ecosystem service assessments. As for landscape analysis, the fundamental uncertainty origins are landscape complexity and methodological uncertainties. Concerning the uncertainty sources of ecosystem service assessments, the complexity of the natural system, respondents' preferences and technical problems play essential roles. By analyzing the assessment process, we find that initial data uncertainty pervades the whole assessment and argue that the limited knowledge about the complexity of ecosystems is the focal origin of uncertainties. For analyzing uncertainties in assessments, we propose systems analysis, scenario simulation and the comparison method as promising strategies. To reduce uncertainties, we assume that actions should integrate continuous learning, expanding respondent numbers and sources, considering representativeness, improving and standardizing assessment methods and optimizing spatial and geobiophysical data.

AB  - Landscape heterogeneity is closely related to the spatial differentiation characteristics of PM2.5 concentration in urbanized areas. Exploring the coordinated changes between landscape evolution and PM2.5 concentration can help alleviate urban pollution from the perspective of process governance. Researchers have mainly focused on a single landscape in a specific area but have largely neglected quantitative comparisons of multiple landscape evolution and PM2.5 concentration changes in different types of cities. Taking two typical inland and waterfront cities in China as examples, this study uses exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial coupling models to analyze the PM2.5 concentration and its coordinated changes with multiple landscapes (i.e., green, blue, and gray), with townships as the basic unit. Results show clear differences in the PM2.5 concentrations in Hohhot and Tianjin. Moreover, the coordinated changes of PM2.5 concentrations with the green landscape in the two regions show opposite trends, owing to the effect of the natural background. The change from green landscapes to other types in Hohhot can increase PM2.5 concentration, with a maximum of 2.04 μg/m3. However, this landscape evolution in Tianjin may inhibit PM2.5, particularly in blue-dominant strong-coupling areas. By comparing the dominant landscape in high-pollution areas and the changes in PM2.5 concentration caused by multiple landscape evolutions, managers can take differentiated measures based on local conditions to provide insights for urban planning strategies in mitigating air pollution.

Little is known about the population health status of the world’s rarest primate, the Hainan gibbon. Here, the largest gut microbiome dataset yet constructed was generated from all five extant breeding groups of the Hainan gibbons, with 42 samples from individuals spanning all ages and sexes, in addition to dry and wet seasons. Groups A and B exhibited higher diversity of gut microbiota and food resources, in contrast to the subsequently established Groups C, D, and E. Significantly, Group C demonstrated the lowest gut microbial diversity and higher abundance of vector-related Pestivirus, which may be attributed to their proximity to the primary forest edge and the village. We also inferred the origin and possible dispersal paths of the newly established Group E. These findings indicate that Hainan gibbons are still facing viral zoonosis and the threat of extinction, as illuminated by an understanding of the gut microbiome and habitat landscape ecology.

AB  - New South Wales (NSW) can be regarded as one of the more “data-rich” parts of the world but its detailed biological data sets, like others elsewhere, are localised. These data are therefore not useable over large geographical areas for consistent reviews of established protected areas or future conservation priorities. In this sense, the constraints of data are similar to those in other parts of the world, including global biodiversity hotspots. We describe here the development of a new classification of landscapes at a scale of 1:250,000 across the whole 802,000 km2 of NSW. The classification is derived mainly from abiotic data and, in conjunction with new data on native vegetation cover, has allowed the first quantitative State-wide review of protected areas and future priorities at a scale approaching that of decisions about land use. We also describe methods for measuring biases in the coverage of reserves in relation to land use potential, mapping numerical conservation priorities across extensive areas, and producing quantitative profiles of priorities for the remaining native vegetation on private land relative to that on other tenures. The same or similar approaches to developing the landscape classification and analysing biases and priorities are feasible for many other jurisdictions or natural regions. We found that most of the 1486 landscapes in NSW are poorly reserved relative to an indicative conservation target of 15% of the total area of each (the baseline target in recent national planning for forest reserves). In the eastern 60% of the State, gaps in the reserve system are related to the concentration of reserves on land with high ruggedness and low potential for intensive land use. We measured the relative priority of landscapes to indicate the urgency of conservation action to prevent conservation targets being compromised (or further compromised) by clearing of native vegetation. Mapping of priorities shows large differences within and between natural regions and land tenures. More than 9% of private land is occupied by high-priority native vegetation and, across the whole State, about 85% of high-priority vegetation occurs on private land.

AB  - Urban riparian ecosystems are now recognized as essential components in determining the vulnerability of nature and human systems to climate change, but still remains uncertainty concerning how to stratify and classify urban riparian landscapes into units of ecological significance at spatial scales appropriate for management. Ecosystem classification presents a tool that allows for quantifying the social and ecological processes of ecosystems so as to shape them into relatively homogeneous management objectives, and provides the potential of offering decision support to urban planners based on urban ecological principles. The purpose of this study is to explore and develop a framework for urban riparian ecosystem classification. The classification framework integrates 9 ecosystem components and 29 spatially-explicit variables that characterized by the biophysical landscape, built environment and human population. Then this framework is applied at the neighbourhood scale in Huangpu River basin, Shanghai city, China, employing hierarchical cluster analysis. The results of the ecosystem classification show that the riparian ecosystems in the Huangpu River could be grouped into three principal categories and these ecosystems are aligned along a gradient of increasing urbanization. We highlight the conservation and payment for riparian ecosystem services delivered in the upstream of Huangpu River, and revegetation and enhancement of riparian ecosystems in the more urbanized downstream area. We also find that riparian vegetation connectivity and coverage were negatively related to land use mix, built environment density, and economic wealth. In terms of riparian vegetation ecology, neighbourhood scale land use mix and built environment density are more influential than socioeconomic background (such as average family income and immigrant status).

AB  - Groundwater is an important component of the hydrological cycle of southern Ontario, significant to water supply and discharge to surface water. To improve overall understanding of key hydrological mechanisms, a proof-of-concept framework is presented that consists of seven typical terrains or hydrogeological settings. Geologic and topographic controls influence each setting as recorded by climate, streamflow, and groundwater level data, which trace how water moves through various parts of the southern Ontario landscape. This hydrogeological framework considers the geology of surface sediment and bedrock, permeability and porosity (inferred), physiography, and topographic gradients to define seven distinctive hydrogeological terrains. The data and watershed selection process allow for concentration on patterns of hydrologic response across the landscape, with less focus on hydrologic accounting of the terrain. The analysis identifies events in climate, stream, and well-monitoring data indicative of influxes and temporal patterns of hydrological and hydrogeological response to local geology and topography, thus differentiating styles of groundwater movement in sediment/bedrock landscapes of the Paleozoic basin and Shield margin. A case study is provided for each setting: five in sediment (clay, sand, gravel, till upland, and thick till); and two in bedrock (crystalline and carbonate). The selected hydrogeological terrains characterize ∼90% of the landscape based on a simplified geological map of southern Ontario. The main hydrogeological characteristics and behaviour of these terrains are proposed as a set of conceptual models representative of near-surface groundwater regimes. Such models can inform water and land resource management as future climates change.
L’eau souterraine est un élément important du cycle hydrologique du sud de l’Ontario, notamment pour l’approvisionnement en eau et la contribution aux eaux de surface. Afin d’améliorer la compréhension globale de mécanismes hydrologiques importants, un cadre de validation de principe est présenté qui consiste en sept reliefs ou milieux hydrologiques typiques. Des facteurs géologiques et topographiques influencent chaque relief, comme en témoignent des données sur le climat, le débit des cours d’eau et les niveaux d’eau souterraine, qui reflètent l’écoulement de l’eau à travers différentes parties du paysage du sud de l’Ontario. Ce cadre hydrogéologique tient compte de la géologie des sédiments de surface et du roc, de la perméabilité et de la porosité (inférée), de la physiographie et de gradients topographiques pour définir sept types de reliefs hydrogéologiques distincts. Le processus de sélection des données et des bassins versants permet de mettre l’accent sur les motifs de réponse hydrologique à l’échelle du paysage, plutôt que sur la quantification de l’hydrologie du relief. L’analyse fait ressortir des épisodes dans les données climatiques, de débit et de surveillance de puits qui indiquent des influx et des motifs temporels des réactions hydrologiques et hydrogéologiques à la géologie et la topographie locales, distinguant ainsi des styles d’écoulement de l’eau souterraine dans les paysages de sédiments/roc du bassin paléozoïque et de la bordure du bouclier. Une étude de cas est présentée pour chaque milieu, dont cinq dans des sédiments (argile, sable, gravier, crête de till et till épais) et deux dans le roc (cristallin et à carbonates). Les reliefs hydrogéologiques sélectionnés caractérisent ~90 % du paysage à la lumière d’une carte géologique simplifiée du sud de l’Ontario. Il est proposé que les principaux comportements et caractéristiques hydrogéologiques de ces reliefs forment un ensemble de modèles conceptuels représentatifs des régimes d’eau souterraine près de la surface. Ces modèles peuvent éclairer la gestion des ressources en eau et en sols dans le contexte des changements climatiques à venir. [Traduit par la Rédaction]

AB  - This study developed and applied a framework for assessing the vulnerability of pan-Canadian water resources to permafrost thaw. The national-scale work addresses a key, but neglected, information gap, as previous research has focused on small scale physical processes and circumpolar trends. The framework was applied to develop the Canadian Water Resources Vulnerability Index to Permafrost Thaw (CWRVIPT) and map the index across the Canadian North. The CWRVIPT is a linearly additive index of permafrost, terrain, disturbance, and climatic conditions and stressors that influence water budgets and aquatic chemistry. Initial results imply water resources in the western Northwest Territories and Hudson Bay Lowlands are most vulnerable to permafrost thaw; however, water resources on Banks, Victoria and Baffin Islands are also relatively vulnerable. Although terrain and permafrost sub-indices are the largest component of the CWRVIPT across a wide swath from the Mackenzie River Delta to the Hudson Bay Lowlands, the climate sub-index is most important farther north over parts of the southern portion of the Arctic Archipelago. The index can be used to identify areas of water resource vulnerability on which to focus observation and research in the Canadian North.
Cette étude a élaboré et appliqué un cadre d’évaluation de la vulnérabilité des ressources en eau pancanadiennes face au dégel du pergélisol. Les travaux de recherche à l’échelle nationale comblent une lacune importante, mais négligée, en matière d’information, car les recherches antérieures ont porté sur les processus physiques à petite échelle et les tendances circumpolaires. Le cadre a été utilisé pour élaborer l’indice canadien de vulnérabilité des ressources en eau au dégel du pergélisol (« CWRVIPT ») et cartographier l’indice dans le Nord canadien. Le CWRVIPT est un indice additif linéaire des conditions et des facteurs de stress du pergélisol, du terrain, de perturbations et du climat qui influent sur le bilan hydrique et la chimie aquatique. Les premiers résultats laissent entendre que les ressources en eau dans l’ouest des Territoires du Nord-Ouest et les basses terres de la baie d’Hudson sont les plus vulnérables au dégel du pergélisol, mais les ressources en eau des îles Banks, Victoria et Baffin sont également relativement vulnérables. Bien que les sous-indices du terrain et du pergélisol constituent la plus grande composante du CWRVIPT sur une vaste bande allant du delta du fleuve Mackenzie aux basses terres de la baie d’Hudson, le sous-indice climatique est le plus important plus au nord sur certaines parties au sud de l’archipel arctique. L’indice peut être utilisé pour déterminer les zones de vulnérabilité des ressources en eau sur lesquelles l’observation et la recherche dans le Nord canadien devraient porter.

AB  - The hydrologic conditions of global wetlands are dramatically changed, and its ecological responses attract the great attention around the world. In recent decades, the water level of the middle of dry season had a tendency of significant increase in Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake (DL and PL, the two largest freshwater lake of China). Landscape pattern is sensitive to the local environmental changes and anthropogenic activity, and could influence the progresses and function of ecosystems. In this study, the landscape pattern between middle of dry season with increased water level (DIW) and that with normal water level (DNW) were compared to reveal the influence of the increasing of water level during the middle of dry season on landscape pattern of DL and PL. The results revealed that the increasing of water level during the middle of dry season caused expanding of deep water (cover increased from 14.40% to 18.36% of the total lake) to shallow water zone and expanding of shallow water (from 6.41% to 10.12%) to mudflat zone in DL; while it caused expanding of deep water (from 24.17% to 46.00%) to shallow water, sand, mudflat and grass zone and expanding of shallow water (from 12.18% to 19.51%) to sand, mudflat and grass zone in PL. In landscape metrics, it caused significant increase of the LPI in PL. In class metrics, it caused the some significant changes of landscape pattern indices (such as TA, LPI, MPS, AMPFDI, MNN and IJI) of the lakes. It had greater effects on the landscape pattern of PL than that of DL. And these changes of landscape pattern would affect birds, fish and mammals.

KW  - Forest landscape restoration
AB  - The forest restoration challenge (globally 2billionha) and the prospect of changing climate with increasing frequency of extreme events argues for approaching restoration from a functional and landscape perspective. Because the practice of restoration utilizes many techniques common to silviculture, no clear line separates ordinary forestry practices from restoration. The distinction may be that extra-ordinary activities are required in the face of degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems. Restoration is driven by the desire to increase sustainability of ecosystems and their services and restoration is likely to have multiple goals arising from the motivations of those involved. The process of setting restoration objectives translates vague goals into feasible, measurable targets and ultimately actions on the ground. Our objective for this review is to synthesize the science underpinning contemporary approaches to forest restoration practice. We focus on methods and present them within a coherent terminology of four restoration strategies: rehabilitation, reconstruction, reclamation, and replacement. While not a consensus terminology, these terms have a logical foundation. Rehabilitation restores desired species composition, structure, or processes to a degraded ecosystem. Reconstruction restores native plant communities on land recently in other resource uses, such as agriculture. Reclamation restores severely degraded land generally devoid of vegetation, often the result of resource extraction, such as mining. Replacement of species (or their locally-adapted genotypes) with new species (or new genotypes) is a response to climate change. Restoration methods are presented as available tools; because adding vegetation is an effective restoration technique, the discussion of methods begins with a description of available plant materials. We then discuss altering composition under different initial overstory conditions, including deployment methods depending upon whether or not an overstory is present, how much of the landscape will be restored, and the complexity of the planting design. We present some major approaches for altering structure in degraded forest stands, and describe approaches for restoration of two key ecosystem processes, fire and flooding. Although we consider stand-level designs, what we describe is mostly scalable to the landscape-level. No restoration project is undertaken in a social vacuum; even stand-level restoration occurs within a system of governance that regulates relationships among key agents. Gathering information and understanding the social dimensions of a restoration project is as necessary as understanding the biophysical dimensions. Social considerations can trump biophysical factors.

AB  - Accurate and timely mapping of agricultural products is a crucial component in management and decision-making for promoting food security and sustainable development. The intricacy of differentiating diverse croplands due to the existence of small and winding agricultural fragments contributes to the complexity of crop classification in arid environments. In this study, we employed a novel hybrid approach, integrating time-series analysis, noisy data quality control, and different machine learning and deep learning models to classify croplands of complex multi-crop systems in central Iran. The classification was based on time series spectral bands of Sentinel-2 images and indices of crop growth phenology, providing valuable insights into the growth cycles of different crops in the region. Additionally, a neural network-based method was used to assess and enhance the quality of training data before modeling. For crop classification, we used four machine learning and deep learning methods including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TCNN), and compared their results before and after quality control measures. The results indicated that after quality control, the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the analyses were considerably improved. RF and TCNN methods demonstrated superior prediction and modeling performance compared to XGBoost and SVM models. The overall accuracy of the four methods increased from 91 %, 87 %, 83 %, and 91 % before quality control to 96 %, 94 %, 89 %, and 95 % after quality control, respectively. The results of this study highlight the effectiveness of employing time-series data and quality control procedures to enhance crop classification in complex agricultural systems. By improving the precision and accuracy of agricultural classifications our findings can contribute to optimizing resource management, food security, and sustainable development goals.

AB  - The Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) is a national soil map and accompanying database of environmental information for all of Canada, produced and maintained by the Canadian Soil Information Service (CanSIS) which is a part of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. The SLC maps were originally published as a set of paper products for individual provinces and regions. The maps were digitized in CanSIS, using one of the first geographic information systems in the world, and linked to soil and landscape attribute tables to serve an evolving variety of spatial modelling applications. The SLCs form the lowest level of the National Ecological Framework for Canada. The latest public release of the SLC is version 3.2, which provides updated soil and landscape information for the agricultural areas of Canada. The SLC v3.2 digital coverage includes an extensive set of relational data tables. The component table lists the soil components in each agricultural polygon along with their predicted dominant slope, class, and extent. The soil component codes are also linked to soil attribute tables which define fundamental soil properties, such as classification and parent material, as well as a description of the soil horizons and key soil attributes to a depth of 100 cm. SLC v3.2 adds a new set of landform tables which identify the major landform type in each polygon and indicates the most likely soil components in the upper, mid slope, lower slope, and depressional positions. These soil and landform attributes are designed to support a wide variety of national and international environmental modelling applications, such as the prediction of soil quality change, soil carbon sequestration, and land productivity for different agricultural crops in response to agricultural policy, land management, and climate change scenarios. Future versions of the SLC are under development that will have improved spatial resolution and include soils data for areas beyond the present agricultural zone of Canada.
Les pédo-paysages du Canada (PPC) présentent une carte nationale des sols et la base de données connexe fournit les caractéristiques environnementales pour l’ensemble du Canada. Les PPC sont compilés et mis à jour par le Service d’information sur les sols du Canada (SISCan) qui fait partie d’Agriculture et Agroalimentaire Canada. Au début, les cartes de PPC étaient publiées en copies papier pour les différentes provinces et régions. Les cartes ont été numérisées dans SISCan, en utilisant un des premiers systèmes d’information géographique au monde, et sont liées aux tables de caractéristiques du sol et des paysages pour desservir une variété grandissante d’applications de modélisation spatiale. Les PPC constituent l’unité la plus petite du Cadre écologique national pour le Canada. La dernière mise en circulation des PPP est la version 3.2, qui fournit des renseignements mis à jour sur le sol et les paysages pour les régions agricoles du Canada. La couverture numérique de la version 3.2 des PPC comprend un ensemble détaillé de tables de données relationnelles. La table des composantes montre les composantes du sol dans chaque polygone ainsi que leur pente dominante, classification et superficie prévues. Les codes de composantes du sol sont aussi liés aux tables d’attributs du sol qui définissent les propriétés fondamentales du sol telles que la classification et le matériel parent, et comprennent aussi une description des horizons du sol et des attributs clés du sol jusqu’à une profondeur de 100 cm. La version 3.2 des PPC ajoute un nouvel ensemble de tables d’information sur le relief qui identifient le principal type de relief dans chaque polygone et indique les composantes les plus probables de sol au haut de la pente, au milieu de la pente et au bas de la pente ainsi que dans les zones de dépression. Ces attributs du sol et du relief sont conçus pour appuyer une grande variété d’applications de modélisation environnementales nationales et internationales, comme celles qui s’intéressent aux prévisions des changements de la qualité du sol, à la séquestration du carbone dans le sol, et à la productivité de la terre pour les différentes cultures agricoles en réaction à des scénarios découlant des politiques agricoles, de la gestion des terres et des changements climatiques. Les prochaines versions des PPC sont en préparation. Elles auront une résolution spatiale améliorée et comprendront des données sur les sols pour des régions au-delà de la zone agricole actuelle du Canada.

AB  - As urban populations grow and cities expand, the challenge of managing urban heat and its environmental impacts becomes increasingly critical. Traditional methods for analyzing urban temperature dynamics often fall short in precisely capturing the complexity of urban landscapes. This paper introduces the 3D Landscape Clustering (3LC) framework, a new tool designed to analyze urban temperature dynamics by factoring in landscape variables. It clusters landscapes into homogeneous groups using high-resolution 3D land cover maps. The 3LC adopts a clustering mechanism to enhance flexibility and objectivity in landscape categorization, thereby enhancing the depth and accuracy of urban climate studies and moving beyond traditional classification frameworks such as the Local Climate Zone (LCZ). Case studies demonstrate its capability to provide detailed insights into the relationships between urban landscape features and temperature variations. Additionally, the paper details how the framework can excel in multi-city analyses and outlines advanced analytical techniques. Promising research opportunities and limitations are identified. This research reshapes our approach to landscape categorization, advancing our understanding of the interactions between landscape and climate dynamics, and contributing to more sustainable, climate-resilient cities.

AB  - Rapid qualitative field methods can be used to evaluate ecological integrity (EI) at a landscape level. This study evaluates the EI of 63 landscape types (LCTs) in Cyprus derived from Landscape Character Mapping. Following a stratified sampling, LCTs were evaluated using 209 Land Description Units (LDUs) i.e., homogeneous map entities, sharing a similar pattern of natural and cultural elements. In every LDU, six ecological integrity (EI) indicators were visually assessed consistently namely naturalness, habitat continuity, number of habitats, dominant habitat type, management intensity and scale. TwoStep Cluster Analysis was employed to identify EI categories, and Categorical Principal Components Analysis (CATPCA) to associate the individual indicators with overall EI in the LDUs. Linear regressions were used to predict EI based on the most important indicators. Forested and shrubland landscapes have consistently good EI with low variation, while urbanized and agricultural landscapes have lower EI. There is great variation in the number of agricultural landscape types and their EI. There are significant linear relationships between EI and naturalness, habitat continuity and intensity. The novelty of this work lies with the fact that it provides the first island-wide study in the Mediterranean assessing EI spatially through a small number of indicators. Results indicate that LCA can be an appropriate consistent and inexpensive spatial framework for assessing EI, which can be directly associated with management intervention to maintain or improve EI.

AB  - Conservation of estuaries is strengthened by an understanding of past and current estuary extent, which helps stakeholders envision resilient estuarine habitats in the future. We used spatial analyses to improve understanding of estuarine habitat and extent in and around 30 US National Estuarine Research Reserves using two approaches, elevation-based mapping and historical mapping. We collaborated with stakeholders to incorporate local knowledge, and found that our methodologies were effective across disparate geographies. Elevation-based mapping proved to be a powerful tool for mapping areas within reach of tides, yielding a better understanding of the past, present, and potential estuary. This approach revealed that US estuaries are or were bigger – often vastly so – than what is shown in most maps. In particular, at over 80 % of studied estuaries, elevation-based mapping detected temperate forested tidal wetlands missed by maps generated primarily from aerial photographs. Historical mapping, conducted consistently across diverse regions, provided a valuable window into past ecological conditions. Our change analysis using historical maps revealed that tidal marsh has undergone dramatic losses on the Pacific coast (average > 60 % loss). On other US coasts, tidal marsh extent has changed less (average < 10 % loss), with marsh losses offset by landward migration; however, marsh migration may have caused net loss of vegetated tidal wetlands due to loss of forested tidal wetlands. Comparing mapping methods revealed important changes that could not be detected using a single method. Each mapping approach had limitations, so combining multiple methods will enhance understanding of both past and present conditions at estuaries worldwide.

AB  - Green space (GS) is a central element of urban ecosystems while, urbanization is substantially changed green land into impervious ecosystems, which has then troubled the equilibrium of the surface thermal energy and the ecosystem services fluxes. This study was intended to explore the response of relative land surface temperature (RLST) intensities to the urban ecosystem- agglomeration dynamics as well as regional thermal environment (RTE) effects on green space in four major cities (i.e., Addis Ababa-Hawassa-Adama-Bahir Dar) of Ethiopia from 1990-2020, using a set of remote sensing images, single-channel algorism, and geospatial analyses. The results showed the trends of GS evolution were: GS loss > GS gain > GS exchange. Besides, the distinct ecosystems as high-temperature zones (RLST more than 2°C) were gradually augmented and significantly intensified between 2010-2020 in all cities, while the proportion of green space was significantly decreased. Due to this, the segregated urban heat islands were gradually inter-weaved and interacted with each other and forming regional heat islands. However, the newly established green space has fewer cooling effects than urban forest and greenery, because RLST of green space loss and gain are substantially disparate. We also confirmed that the regional thermal environment is not only prejudiced by ecosystem patterns and processes besides substantially conquered by the particular GS change processes as well as RHI dynamics and evolution rate.

AB  - Wetlands play crucial ecological roles in carbon sequestration, flood control, and biodiversity preservation. The effective long-term monitoring of wetland dynamics is essential for sustainable management and conservation. However, obtaining wetland samples over multiple years and ensuring high classification accuracy pose unique challenges for precise extraction and spatiotemporal analyses. To address these issues, a sample migration algorithm was used to describe the interannual migration of wetland classification samples. The object-based hierarchical random forest (OBHRF) and object-based hierarchical decision tree (OBHDT) methods were integrated and combined with Landsat time-series data to map 11 wetland types and assess wetland dynamics in Jiangsu Province from 1985 to 2021. Change detection was used to investigate the land-use or landcover factors driving wetland dynamics, and a multivariate linear regression model was used to investigate the factors affecting interannual changes in wetland area. The optimal threshold for the cross-year migration of wetland samples occurred at a Euclidean distance ≤ 0.09, and a spectral angular distance ≥ 0.97. The overall accuracy of the wetland maps exceeded 79.36 %. Spatiotemporal dynamic analysis revealed a decline in the natural wetland area from 41.61 × 103 km2 to 39.12 × 103 km2, with over 68.5 % of the loss attributed to the expansion of aquaculture ponds and dry farmland from 1985 to 2021. Artificial wetlands increased from 31.71 × 103 km2 to 35.38 × 103 km2, with over 78.66 % of the gain attributed to the reduction in dry farmland. Policy-regulated economic development and population size were the main factors affecting changes in wetland areas. This study successfully mapped detailed long-term wetland maps and identified the drivers of wetland dynamics. The findings of this study provide an important reference for accurate wetland classification and contribute to the sustainable utilization and protection of wetlands in Jiangsu and across China.

AB  - Urban heat is one of the most prominent challenges of urbanization. The nature of extraordinarily spatially heterogeneous landscape in cities may provide nature-based solutions to solving the urban heat problems. Here we aimed to discover the most desirable landscape structure vividly demonstrated in urban areas that we can adopt for heat mitigation. We conducted our study in Xi'an, an ancient capital of China, using land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from Landsat8, landscape features interpreted from SPOT6 along with the urban-rural gradient. We found that large LST variability (as high as 18.11 °C) existed within the same urban intensity (UI) and it is very promising to see that potential of heat mitigation broadened with increasing urbanization. This is very likely thanks to the archaic urban design of Xi'an, which incorporates and preserves the wisdom of the ancients in the urban landscape layout. We revealed two landscape composition associated desirable cooling landscape structure models (i.e., the enhancement of blue spaces and the enhancement of green spaces) generally applicable for all urban environments, and three landscape configuration related desirable cooling models, that are the complex grey infrastructure model, the aggregated green space model, and the connected and regular model of both grey and green infrastructures, which can be exquisitely adopted at low, high and intermediate urban intensity gradients.

AB  - An ecosystem is a system formed by the interaction of a community of organisms with their environment within a geographic unit or region, and ecosystem sustainability is an ecosystem’s capacity to endure and maintain its functions and services indefinitely. Although some literature is emerging on the development of sustainability science frameworks, there is little information available on framing ecosystem sustainability. Part of the challenge is that it requires the full integration of natural and human systems with a quantitative nexus among all fundamental elements of an ecosystem. In this chapter, we first review the key elements of ecosystem sustainability, and then provide a review of remote sensing capabilities to provide spatio-temporal dynamics of key indicators of an ecosystem that are critical to its sustainability. While traditional sustainability science tends to focus on four pillars of sustainability—social, environmental, economic, and cultural—ecosystem sustainability will need to be placed in a global context. This chapter focuses on the environmental dimension of sustainability science with a review of remote sensing capabilities for such applications.

AB  - Identification of the intrinsic properties regulating complex systems’ development contributes to a refined comprehension of their inherent transformations over time. Seen as a local context undergoing non-linear changes as a response to socioeconomic dynamics, landscape evolution over time provides a paradigmatic issue when examining the key property of ‘rapidity-of-change’ characteristic of any complex system. The present study introduces an exploratory approach grounded on mathematical morphology to investigate ‘rapidity-of-change’ of a landscape system evolving in response to external stimuli over 70 years (1948–2018). This framework was applied to a real case (metropolitan Athens, Greece) assessing structural changes in built-up settlements reflected in seven landscape types derived from mathematical morphology. A Multi-way Factor Analysis (MFA) quantified the evolution of landscape types from diachronic land-use maps. A standardized metric of ‘rapidity-of-change’ was calculated from MFA outcomes over six sub-periods and confronted with the background socioeconomic context. Taken as an intrinsic attribute of complex systems, ‘rapidity-of-change’ in Athens’ landscape was largely heterogeneous over time, being more intense during the last economic expansion (2000–2006) under the impulse of the Olympic Games. Intermediate values of ‘rapidity-of-change’ were associated with population growth and intense social transformations. The lowest level of ‘rapidity-of-change’ was finally recorded in correspondence with 2007 recession. Reflecting the intrinsic pressure of socioeconomic growth in contemporary cities, ‘rapidity-of-change’ in landscape systems demonstrated to be a honest proxy of metropolitan cycles, economic downtowns, and socio-demographic dynamics. Delineating long-term transformations in the ‘form-function’ relationship allows evaluation of (direct or indirect) planning impacts on metropolitan development.

AB  - Equitable allocation of protection costs across jurisdictions is crucial to promoting the establishment of transboundary ecological networks (ENs). To explore the influence of cost allocation methods on transboundary ENs, this study took four cities surrounding Taihu lake as study case, and developed five allocation criteria under the targets of maximum protection areas (S1) and best revenue (S2), including allocating equally (Ae), allocating by economic development (Ed), source revenue (Er), source area (Ea) and global coordination (Gc), for example, “S1-Gc” represented global coordination under target S1, Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) and least-cost paths (LCPs) methods were employed to identify ecological sources and corridors, respectively. Results showed S1-Gc and S2-Gc achieved the largest protection area (about 1800 km2) with the highest input cost, the patch and corridors numbers, corridor length and revenue in S2-Gc were the highest, and were 139 %, 163 %, 83 % and 105 % higher than those in S1-Gc, it indicated S2-Gc could provide more benefits to biodiversity. S1-Ed achieved the highest network structure index, while the protected area and revenue were 40.75 % and 22.27 % lower than those of S1-Gc, respectively. Results emphasized differences in allocating criteria could lead to varying protection outcomes, and no single strategy universally satisfies all objectives. Therefore, decision-makers should explicitly define priorities during scenario design based on input cost and its corresponding protection effects, it could promote stakeholders to contribute proportionally to conservation efforts. Results provide valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners in optimizing cost allocation strategies and designing effective conservation plans in multi-jurisdictional regions.

AB  - The green infrastructure (GI) network, an important nature-based solution (NBS) strategy, is pivotal for sustainable urban development. However, current research perspectives focus on constructing a static GI network, and research on evaluating and protecting GI networks in the context of spatiotemporal changes has been limited. This research aims to comprehensively characterise the spatio-temporal changes in the GI network and protect its efficiency. We selected Dalian City as a case study and applied the Future Land-use Simulation (FLUS) model to predict its land use for 2030 and 2040. Based on predicted and historical land-use data, the 1990–2040 GI network of Dalian City was constructed utilising the Integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs (InVEST), morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model, while its spatiotemporal changes were evaluated. The results revealed that the hub area exhibited positive growth over time, whereas the link lengths showed an opposite trend. Furthermore, the overall position of the GI network shifted toward the southwest. The flatness indicator detected that the direction of the GI network shape gradually became less pronounced. Consequently, the structure of the GI network shifted from multi-centre to mono-centre. Additionally, priority protection for hubs is mainly in the northeast, while links are primarily in the coastal regions. The urgency of protection for both increases over time. This research developed a dynamic GI network construction and assessment method, providing a scientific basis and reference for future rational GI network planning, ecological protection planning, and related land policy formulation.

AB  - The wind energy industry is developing rapidly in China with a maximum capacity worldwide. Meanwhile, the stability of the ecological network is challenged by extensive renewable energy expansion. There are still research deficiencies in wind farm ecological impacts at project scale from an ecological restoration perspective. It is of great necessity to monitor the ecological impacts with time going and explore ecological restoration strategies for wind power development. The research case of Zhongying Wind Farm is selected based on investigation and interviews regarding its ecological impact in the prior study. It employs a comparative methodology by comparing the ecological quality before and after the construction of Zhongying Wind Farm. Raw data from Landsat 8, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and wind turbine statistics originating from open data platforms are analyzed and visually represented with ArcGIS. This paper establishes an ecological network based on morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and the Minimum Cumulative Resistance (MCR) model to quantify wind farms’ impacts on ecological corridors. The circuit theory and Pajek software are used to identify and categorize the ecological nodes into weak and obstacle points. The results reveal that ecological impacts on ecological corridors decay with distance, reflecting changes in length, connection strength and cumulative values of corridors. While the impacts on ecological nodes depend on nodes’ attributes: the number of weak points increased by 18.5 %, and obstacle points increased by 350 %, with their locations shifting from the edges of urban construction sites to the edges of wind farm. Differentiated strategies are proposed according to the impact magnitude of each ecological corridor and node: such as dynamic inspection mechanism, construction prohibition for protection; corridor structure and function recovering, stepping stones addition for restoration; buffer belts, warning radar, and monetary schemes for compensation. This research fills the gap of ecological impact assessment under the challenges of wind energy expansion. It helps to balance wind energy development and ecological restoration at the regional level.

AB  - Despite a proven record of accurate floodplain mapping, complex hydrodynamic models lack efficiency due to their data-intensive approach and high computation time. As fast-computing low-complexity alternatives, topography-based hydrogeomorphic approaches are being increasingly used in recent times. Yet, there is little evidence to suggest whether and to what extent such topography-based approaches, simply relying on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), can effectively delineate floodplains/flood hazard zones in data-scarce, highly complex mountainous terrains. We fill this knowledge-gap by conducting a floodplain mapping comparative assessment with three topography-based approaches along a 56-km river reach in the North West Himalayas (Beas River, India). Specifically, we generated floodplain extent using Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), and Slope Position (SP), and estimated their relative differences compared to a reference inundation extent simulated by MIKE11 hydrodynamic model. The unique feature of our study was an extensive field survey to collect longitudinal and cross-sectional elevation data across 223 locations, which allowed us to verify vertical accuracy across multiple alternative DEMs and subsequently improve the selected DEM via bathymetry integration. Statistical measures estimating the degree of consistency across three topography-based approaches suggested that HAND and TWI produce more reasonable floodplain maps than SP. HAND-based floodplain demonstrated greater agreement with the model-simulated reference map. TWI showed moderate predictability with a tendency of underestimating floodplains. SP was largely inconsistent, demarcating floodplains in areas where the hydrodynamic model found uplands and vice versa. Our study can offer critical insights to support floodplain hydrological, biological, and habitat studies across the world’s developing countries where locally relevant delineation of floodplains remains challenging due to data scarcity.

AB  - The ecological stability of coastal areas is seriously affected by tidal flat reclamation. Understanding the spatial characteristics of the impact of reclamation on stability, as well as the contribution of different use types of reclamation to stability change, is important for mitigating the negative effects of reclamation. In this study, multi-source and multi-temporal remote sensing images were combined to quantitatively analyze the relationship between reclamation and stability in different regions of the coastal area in Jiangsu Province, as well as the relative contribution of different use types of reclamation to the stability change. The results showed that: Different forms of statistical relationships between reclamation and stability existed in reclaimed area and non-reclaimed area, respectively, while a significant quadratic function relationship existed in the whole affected area, and the stability index decreased first and then increased with the increase of reclamation amount, with a threshold of 1243 km2; In different buffer zones within the non-reclaimed area, the impact intensity of reclamation showed spatial decay characteristics; The use type of reclamation that has the greatest impact on stability in the reclaimed area is aquaculture land, while in the non-reclaimed area it is arable land. In addition, aquaculture land, arable land and hydraulic engineering land have negative effects on stability, while salt industry land has positive effects.

AB  - The recovery of wetland function and biodiversity conservation aroused considerable interest in the past decades. Although many advances have been achieved in revealing disturbing factors on plants diversity, the knowledge of biodiversity manipulation, landscape configuration and ecosystem process in restored wetlands remains incomplete. To address this issue, the landscape of 20 restored wetlands' vegetation was classified into five vegetation formations including: upland plants, wet grassland, emergent plants, floating plants and submerged plants. Meanwhile, the configuration of landscape, plants' function traits and the structure of plants communities of each wetland were analyzed. A total of 142 herbaceous plants were identified from 399 samples of 20 lakeside wetlands. The top five predominant species were Typha orientalis, Alternanthera philoxeroides, Phragmites australis, Echinochloa caudata, and Erigeron canadensis. The highest of diversity index was observed in upland plants with Shannon-Wiener index (H) of 0.92 while higher richness of plants was obtained in wet grassland with species of 88. In dry year, the immigration of upland xerophyte and obligated aquatic species to facultative area increased the biodiversity of the ecotone. Meanwhile, this change may also aggravate the diffusion risk of exotic invasive species Erigeron canadensis. Additionally, the results indicated that number and evenness of landscape outweighed Shannon diversity index (SHDI) of wetlands in shaping the richness and diversity of wetland plants. Whereas, the high value of maximum proportion of landscape (Pmax) have reduced the landscape evenness and species richness. A suggested Pmax of <0.5 was benefit for the stability and biodiversity of restored wetlands.

AB  - The geomorphology of the coastal islands of the northern Bay of Bengal is complex and dynamic in nature. During contemporary times, the geomorphology of coastal islands has been severely influenced by rising sea levels, imposing environmental stress on natural systems. Coastal island progradation and landscape loss scenarios exhibit complex behavior and are influenced by natural processes of fluvial and marine systems. Landscape geomorphic features continuously transform one into another by the natural causal mechanisms and response along with ethnographic interventions at the major islands of the Meghna estuary, which largely impacted ecosystem services, food security, and livelihood patterns of the coastal community. This paper provides historical geomorphological change statistics, the stage of development or evolution of coastal islands, dynamics progradation scenarios, landscape net loss or gain, rate of hereinafter sea-level rise, coastal island stability, impacts of sea level rise on the coastal island geomorphology, and landscape ecology. The geomorphological change of coastal islands have been assessed from ancient cartographic maps (i.e. Rennell's Map in 1776, Tassin's Map in 1840, and Topographic Survey Map in 1943) and remotely sensed satellite imagery of Landsat mission (1972–2021) by using advance RS and GIS tools via overlay analysis techniques. Using time series tidal gauge water level data (1993–2022), the present study analyzes historical trends in sea level rise and assesses its impacts on coastal ecosystems. The study finding demonstrated that coastal islands geomorphology of the northern Bay of Bengal continuously change by fluvial and marine process. Among the coastal island in the study area, the largest island Bhola was displayed noticeable erosion 192.96 km2 with an annual rate of erosion 2.47 km2/yr during the time span between 1943 and 2021. In the northern Bay of Bengal, the results from tidal gauge water level analysis revealed that the yearly maximum sea level rise rate was 9.7 mm/yr, with a strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.30), at a 95% confidence level. The study outcome helps in coastal risk assessment, mitigation strategies, development planning, and coastal resources management.

AB  - Land cover mapping in complex environments can be challenging due to their landscape heterogeneity. With the increasing availability of various open-access remotely sensed datasets, more images acquired by different sensors and on different dates tend to be used to improve land cover classification accuracy. Selecting an appropriate feature domain with the best landscape separability is therefore crucial in meeting the requirement of computational efficiency and model interpretability. Variable selection is widely used in pattern recognition to enhance model parsimony. This study focused on the variable selection process and proposed a series of methods to select the optimal feature domain to improve land cover classification in a complex urbanized coastal area. Two decision tree models (CART-Classification and Regression Tree and CIT-Conditional Inference Tree) and five variable importance measures (GINI, PVIM-Permutated Variable Importance Measure, MD- Minimum Depth, IPM-Intervention of Prediction Measure, and CPVIM-Conditional Permutation Variable Importance Measure) based on random forests were considered. Variable importance measures were applied to a set of spectral, spatial and temporal features derived from medium-resolution satellite images. Backward elimination methods were used to select the optimal feature subset. It is found that compared to the traditional band-only model, the variable selection process can significantly improve the model parsimony and computational efficiency. The CPVIM based on CIT decision tree model was more reliable in selecting relevant features regardless their correlations, but CART tended to generate higher classification accuracy. Therefore, the combination of the CART model and the ranking from the CPVIM variable measure is recommended to achieve higher classification accuracy and better data interpretability. The novelty of our work is with the insight into the merits of integrating variable selection in the land cover classification process over complex environments.

AB  - Shade is an effective measure for reducing outdoor heat exposure. More infrastructure is needed to protect urban populations from direct sunlight during outdoor travels in hot weather, but shade is often overlooked in planning. This research uses the metropolitan area of Nanjing, China, as a case study to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of population movement and shade, utilizing data from mobile phones and airborne LiDAR. The results reveal a dynamic spatial correlation between shade coverage and outdoor population density: positive in the morning and late afternoon and negative at midday, which indicates a spatial mismatch during high solar elevation angles. This study assesses the potential for developing green spaces to provide shade infrastructure, recognizing the community as the fundamental planning unit for human activities. We found that only 17 % of communities in Nanjing possess a high potential for greening. The greening potential of most communities does not meet their shade demand. We introduce the concept of shade-optimized zoning and develop shade infrastructure optimization strategies based on the “necessity-feasibility” framework. This urban shade planning analysis framework includes shade mapping, shade infrastructure demand classification, an assessment of shade potential, shade optimization zoning, and a solution proposal to promote climate-resilient cities.

AB  - Landscape sustainability depends on the design of landscape patterns that can be guided by ecosystem services (ESs). Clarifying the impacts of landscape configurations on ESs and their trade-offs will facilitate landscape planning and management to achieve the best design without changing most landscape compositions. However, limited work has focused on these impacts, and whether these impacts are the same on different compositions remains unexplored. Thus, this study analyzes the impacts of landscape configurations on ESs and their trade-offs for different compositions. In this analysis, Gaussian mixture model was used to cluster the landscape by compositions, five important ESs (crop production, water yield, carbon storage, soil retention, and outdoor recreation) were quantified, and the constraint line was used to analyze the impact, taking the Xiangjiang River Basin as an example. Results showed that three clusters of landscape compositions, which are similar to the urban–rural–natural gradient, were identified. Furthermore, the impacts of landscape configurations on ESs and their trade-offs had largely the same direction in different compositions. However, change in landscape composition makes the high correlations among them weaker or shift to constraint impacts. Based on the results of the study, we can not only contribute to local landscape development but also argue three general approaches for landscape planning and management. First, considering the trade-offs and making a choice adapted to local conditions. Second, adjusting landscape configurations with virtually no changes of compositions. Third, external intervention based on rational landscape configurations.

Diverse, reliable, and resilient networks of information, finance, and seedlings are essential for the restoration movement to be sustainable. The study identifies that key resource flows are not directly accessible to the farmers, who are the key implementers of restoration in Rwanda. The study identifies the need to first understand and then strengthen these networks by mapping actors’ resource flows, priorities and values, and then developing a strategy for change. By considering actor networks, restoration interventions can be more efficient regarding resources, collaboration and outreach. Moreover, conflicts and bottlenecks can be more easily anticipated.

AB  - Farmland extraction has been a pivotal research challenge for decades in remote sensing. Breakthrough progress has been made by relevant studies due to the advanced deep learning-based techniques. However, existing methods still pay little attention to the simultaneous instance-level farmland extraction and semantic-based 3D attribute analysis, which are essential for enabling more various agricultural applications. Additionally, most bimodal methods apply simple projection to convert high-dimensional features to low-dimensional space for feature interaction, which inevitably underutilizes the advantages of bimodal learning and leads to lamentable information loss. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end bimodal network, named Image-Point Cloud Embedding Network (IPCE-Net), that innovatively employs a dual-stream branch architecture to concurrently perform image-based farmland instance segmentation and point cloud-based semantic segmentation. Furthermore, by leveraging the Heterogeneous Conversion Module (HCM), the IPCE-Net effectively reconciles the modality disparities between images and point clouds and achieves stage-by-stage feature interaction during the bimodal learning process, thus achieving higher performance than unimodal learning. Experiments on two datasets show that IPCE-Net achieves superior performance in both farmland instance extraction and point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. For farmland instance extraction, the instance-level mAP and pixel-level IoU metrics reach 74.9% and 79.6%, respectively, being considerably higher than other classical image-based instance segmentation methods. For the point cloud semantic segmentation, the OA and mIoU metrics are 93.8% and 66.1%, with a remarkable improvement of at least 1.3% and 8.2%, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches. Moreover, intelligent analysis based on the interconnection of IPCE-Net and GPT-4 transforms the abstract categorical information into easy-to-understand measurable information, demonstrating its great potential for practical applications in precision and smart agriculture.

AB  - The local climate zone (LCZ) has been an important land surface classification used to differentiate urban climate between localities. The general knowledge maps of LCZ studies are needed when LCZ-related research has attracted great attention. This study integrated bibliometrics and critical review to understand the status quo and suggest future research directions. Bibliometrics provided a statistical technique to explore large volumes of article data from the Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases, based on the Co-Occurrence 13.4 (COOC) software. The bibliometric results indicated a rapid increase in LCZ publications and identified the high-frequency keywords which can be clustered into two groups, including a human thermal comfort-related group and the other urban climatology-related one. From 2011 to 2020, the effects of land use and urban morphology on urban climate and heat island effects predominated the LCZ-related research. Since 2021, the research focuses had shifted to the fields of thermal environment and heatwave, due to the growing demand for human thermal comfort and heat risk reduction. Moreover, this study identified ‘Land Surface Temperature’ and ‘Heatwave’ as two focuses of LCZ-related research during the last decade. Their critical reviews demonstrated the need for additional in-depth LCZ-heatwave studies that consider the risk of human exposure. This study also recommended incorporating hydrological concerns and social issues into the LCZ plan for a more integrated LCZ research outlook. Overall, this study provides not only a comprehensive understanding of LCZ knowledge networks, but also critical details on research focuses and potential research prospects.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation poses a significant threat to intact ecosystems and the natural movements of species. However, research on functional connectivity that reflects the movement probability of widespread species across large spatiotemporal scale remains limited. To address this, we constructed omnidirectional connectivity in China from 1985 to 2020, using morphological spatial pattern analysis methods and circuit theory. In addition, we investigated the primary drivers of connectivity changes and explored conflicts with land cover changes. Our results demonstrated that overall omnidirectional connectivity is affected by the degree of fragmentation within landscape core areas. During this period, overall connectivity and landscape core area in China decreased by 1.2 % and 2.5 %, respectively, while the connectivity within core areas increased by 0.3 %. Forest reduction and cropland expansion were identified as the primary drivers of decreased connectivity in China. Forests, as crucial components of intact core areas, play a vital role in maintaining connectivity. Conversely, cropland expansion has exacerbated habitat fragmentation, leading to a decline in connectivity, particularly in the Southwest Basin. Additionally, connectivity in the Hai River Basin decreased due to an increase in impervious surface, whereas in the Continental Basin, it declined due to an expansion of barren land. Omnidirectional connectivity is crucial for maintaining intact ecosystems and provides a scientific foundation for spatial planning.

AB  - Aquaculture has played a significant and growing role in the provision of food, food security, and job creation, while simultaneously establishing itself as an important agricultural activity subject to increasingly stringent market practices. The generation of spatial information on aquaculture activity in Brazil can support more assertive planning of new enterprises as well as enable the monitoring of this activity over time, fulfilling an agenda of sustainable aquaculture growth in the country. The aim of this article was to map aquaculture areas in the state of Paraná (Brazil) by developing an automated methodology for the extraction of aquaculture ponds. The methodology was implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and utilized satellite images with a spatial resolution of 4.77 m from Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) Program – Planet. The process involved pixel-oriented classification of satellite images and the utilization of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm for classification, based on 1200 training samples. The accuracy of the mapping and the algorithm was evaluated using Producer Accuracy (PA), User Accuracy (UA), and Overall Accuracy (OA). The mapping achieved an OA of 0.87, with a PA of 0.89 and a UA of 0.96 for the aquaculture class, and a PA of 0.66 and a UA of 0.41 for the non-aquaculture class. 42,369 aquaculture ponds were identified in the study area, covering a total area of 11,515 ha. The ponds had sizes smaller than 0.7 ha and non-circular shapes (compactness 0.70). Around 40% of the identified aquaculture tanks were concentrated in just two out of the ten analyzed mesoregions, accounting for 40% of the water surface area used for aquaculture in Paraná. Considering that the results obtained show potential to fill the gap in geospatial information about state aquaculture, our methodology would provide a broad understanding of the state’s aquaculture framework, definition of regions with capacity for the expansion of aquaculture ponds, accuracy in estimating the state’s productive space, monitoring the improper expansion of aquaculture areas, as well as establishing locations where the pressure on water resources by aquaculture prevents the expansion of this activity. Therefore, this study could benefit public and private organizations, and other stakeholders, by systematically monitoring aquaculture production in the country’s leading fish farming state, contributing to assertive decisions in regions where aquaculture production needs to expand sustainably.

AB  - Natural forest ecosystems are vital environmental resources that provide multiple benefits to society, making it imperative for them to be monitored and mapped for practical management purposes. Satellite remote sensing technology is a new source of data and information for forest management and conservation. This study, therefore, applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to Landsat 8 image for mapping a natural forest in South Africa. The objectives were to classify the forest into specific thematic cover classes that indicate its condition, compare the classification performance of the two algorithms based on their default parameters, and determine the most important variables that contributed to the mapping accuracy. The closed canopy forest was determined as the dominant thematic class, followed in descending order by the open canopy forest, grassland, and bare sites. Both algorithms obtained high classification accuracies of above 95%, though the SVM was slightly superior to the RF. The McNemer test indicated that the difference in performance between the two algorithms was statistically insignificant. The most important variables that contributed to the accuracy were the red, blue, green, Near Infrared and Short-Wave Infrared bands, which is attributed to their sensitivity to vegetation. The information provided through the study can be utilized for the planning, management and prioritization initiatives aimed at the protection and conservation of the forest reserve and similar forest ecosystems. The mapping approach could be used for other natural forest ecosystems to ascertain the spatial coverage of the specific thematic cover for conservation purposes. The SVM is recommended for forest ecosystem mapping as it optimally utilized the capabilities of the spectral bands that reflect their actual importance in the mapping of each cover class. The bands identified as important variables can be incorporated as part of input variables when using Landsat 8 satellite imagery for natural forest mapping.

AB  - Achieving carbon neutrality through increasing carbon sinks is a crucial strategy for reaching long-term climate objectives. During rapid urbanization, the degradation of vegetation structure and quantity in fragmented patches leads to the reduction of the carbon sink capacity. Establishing the well-design ecological spatial network is crucial for improving the carbon sink capacity. This study focuses on enhancing the carbon sink capacity in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area (WMA) through a four-step approach–identification, construction, assessment, and optimization–to improve the ecological spatial structure of carbon sink patches and increase carbon sink capacity. The results show that we initially built 27 carbon sink patches and 52 networks, prioritizing 15 core networks. Due to the low connectivity between the Western and other regions, we added 18 steppingstones and 12 networks to enhance overall connectivity and stability of spatial network. Verification shows that our scheme benefits the connectivity and stability of whole ecological network of WMA, and increases the total carbon sink by 11.17 Mt CO2. This research enriches methods for increasing carbon sinks in urban areas and provides theoretical support for achieving carbon neutrality.

AB  - In North America, different strains of the Lyme disease-causing bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto cluster into phylogenetic groups that are associated with different levels of pathogenicity and, for some, specific rodent reservoir hosts. Here we explore whether landscape connectivity, by impacting host dispersal, influences B. burgdorferi s.s. spread patterns. This question is central to modelling spatial patterns of the spread of Lyme disease risk in the zone of northward range-expansion of B. burgdorferi s.s. in southeastern Canada where the study was conducted. We used multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) to characterise B. burgdorferi s.s. in positive ticks collected at 13 sites in southern Quebec, Canada during the early stages of B. burgdorferi s.s. invasion. We used mixed effects logistic regression to investigate whether landscape connectivity (probability of connectivity; PC) affected the probability that samples collected at different sites were of the same strain (MLST sequence type: ST). PC was calculated from a habitat map based on high spatial resolution (15 m) Landsat 8 imagery to identify woodland habitat that are preferred by rodent hosts of B. burgdorferi s.s. There was a significant positive association between the likelihood that two samples were of the same ST and PC, when PC values were grouped into three categories of low, medium and high. When analysing data for individual STs, samples at different sites were significantly more likely to be the same when PC was higher for the rodent-associated ST1. These findings support the hypothesis that dispersion trajectories of B. burgdorferi s.s. in general, and some rodent-associated strains in particular, are at least partly determined by landscape connectivity. This may suggest that dispersion of B. burgdorferi s.s. is more common by terrestrial mammal hosts (which would likely disperse according to landscape connectivity) than by birds, the dispersal of which is likely less constrained by landscape. This study suggests that accounting for landscape connectivity may improve model-based predictions of spatial spread patterns of B. burgdorferi s.s. The findings are consistent with possible past dispersal patterns of B. burgdorferi s.s. as determined by phylogeographic studies.

AB  - Urban human thermal stress can be inaccurately estimated along with less-understood heat heterogeneity due to the absence of high-resolution meteorological information and realistic human behavior representation. To this end, we coupled a regional climate model (weather research and forecasting model, WRF) and a human energy balance model (human-environment adaptive thermal stress model, HEATS) to predict pedestrian's dynamic thermal stress at a neighborhood scale. The WRF-human coupling system resolves human-environment heat exchanges based on meteorological and topographical information with the consideration of dynamic human activities. The coupling system has been tested and utilized to study dynamic heat stress in a typical hot, humid, and mountainous city, Hong Kong. Our results revealed widespread heat heterogeneity with up to 7 °C difference in Physiological Subjective Temperature (PST) in the core urban area, and extreme heat exposure (up to 45 °C PST) in calm-wind zones at noon. Heat stress can be further aggregated considering realistic human behaviors such as extra clothing (e.g., protective facemask during pandemics) and physical exercise (e.g., walking along inclined terrain). Optimal-thermal-comfort routes have been designed and suggested based on the simulated neighborhood-scale heat stress map.

AB  - Men and women interact with water resources and landscapes in different ways, and there are frequent criticisms that little research is undertaken across disciplines to address this issue. Biophysical scientists in particular struggle with how to integrate “gendered” water uses into models that are necessarily based on prevailing laws and equations that describe the movement of water through the hydrological cycle, independent of social constructs. We explore the challenges faced in developing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research approaches and then present a simple yet innovative socio-hydrological approach using participatory three-dimensional maps. As a case study, we describe undertaking this process in Ethiopia where two three-dimensional maps (men's and women's) were separately generated to represent the same 20 km2 landscape. Mapping results indicated important distinctions in how men and women view landscapes with regard to the number and types of ecosystem services identified. For example, only women identified holy water sites along streams, while men identified twice as many sacred trees on the landscape. There was a clear focus and detailed knowledge about soils among participants in both groups. Maps developed as part of this exercise were successfully used as the principal land use input for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and results indicate that this is a valid strategy that enhances scientific knowledge and understanding of overall landscapes and ultimately adds value to research for development questions.

AB  - The landscape crisis and the climate crisis strongly affect coastal landscapes in many coastal regions worldwide. Evidence shows that the difficulty of governing coastal regions has increased alongside the attractiveness of contemporary societies for settlements near the coastline. There is a growing debate in landscape governance conceptualisation and operationalisation, in landscape research. Despite the significant progress on this theme, empirical discussions on coastal landscapes are scarce, a trend already followed by landscape and coastal planning and management debates, highlighting the need for empirical research. This article explores this research gap, conducting an evolutionary analysis of the governance of the coastal region in Portugal, tracing the co-evolution of its institutions and actors since 1950 to understand whether the landscape concept has been integrated into the governance of the coastal region. Our research design comprised two main parts. Firstly, we conducted a literature review comparing the Portuguese landscape and coastal governance diachronic analysis with the evolution at the European level. Secondly, we undertook a content analysis of the principal legislative institutions over the analysed time frame. Results reveal that Portuguese governance evolution diverges somehow from European trends, particularly after the European Landscape Convention, and show that the integration of the landscape concept into the coastal governance system was strongly dependent on powerful actors, their particular interests, values and stocks of knowledge. Along its evolutionary path, the imperative for coastal landscape governance arises from recognising its pivotal role in addressing the intricate and interconnected challenges inherent to coastal regions, needing further research to advance its theoretical and empirical knowledge.

AB  - It is important to predict the habitat of the migratory bird Cygnus columbianus (tundra swan) at different water levels when generating wetland conservation strategies. Poyang Lake is an important wintering habitat on the migration route of tundra swans. However, the relationship between water level and suitable habitat area is still largely unknown. Therefore, this study employed Maxent to model and predict the five leading environmental factors and their corresponding thresholds affecting the habitat selection of tundra swans. Based on this, the study assessed habitat suitability for tundra swans at different water levels and discussed how water level changes impacted the habitats. Results showed that: (1) Soil humidity, distance to settlements, elevation, wetland landscape type, and NDVI (Normalized difference vegetation index) played dominant roles in the habitat selection of tundra swans. (2) The southwestern lakelets were preferred habitats for tundra swans, whereas the lake branches in the northern region were potentially suitable at various water levels. The eastern area of the study area was more affected by water level changes than the western area. (3) There was a significant correlation between habitat area and water level change.
