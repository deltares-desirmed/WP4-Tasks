AB  - The ethanol industries in the United States and China are witnessing a surge in the production of co-products, especially dried distillers' grains with solubles (DDGS). In the U.S., 90 % of maize-based ethanol byproducts are used for livestock feed, with 38.7 % of 14,575 million bushels repurposed in 2020. The U.S. also contributed 36 % of global maize shipments that year. China achieved a 98.2 % self-sufficiency rate in maize, producing 260.8 million metric tons and importing only 4.8 million metric tons in 2019. However, higher mycotoxin levels in DDGS, up to three times those in raw grain, cost the swine industry $9 million annually due to reduced weight gain from fumonisins. This review examines corn, DDGS, and ethanol production, spotlighting China and the USA. It addresses mycotoxin contamination in DDGS and corn, detailing its adverse effects on animal health. It also explores current challenges in DDGS mycotoxin contamination, focusing on processing, nutrition, and product quality. The propose future research directions to prevent mycotoxin contamination, ensuring a safer and more efficient industry. The increasing demand for animal products, climate change, and food safety issues highlight the need for improved food supply and diverse feed materials. Mycotoxin contamination poses significant health risks in feed. Modernizing detection methods for rapid, accurate results is essential to reduce economic losses. A comprehensive detoxification approach, including physical, chemical, and biological methods, is crucial. Ongoing research and strategic measures are vital to combat mycotoxin contamination, ensuring safe and efficient animal husbandry practices.

AB  - The human perception and valuation of landscapes is a complex process but has been pragmatically advanced through public participation GIS (PPGIS). PPGIS methods have the capacity to generate spatial data to empirically examine relationships between human landscape values and physical landscape character. In 2011, PPGIS methods were used to identify a range of social landscape values for two regions in southern New Zealand, Otago and Southland. Seven of these landscape values were analysed to identify significant relationships with physical landscape character from the New Zealand Landscape Classification system. In this paper we examine methods to extrapolate landscape values from this regional data set to a national level using these landscape value and character relationships. In the absence of empirical value data at a national level, we examine two quantitative approaches for extrapolating landscape values: (1) landscape component weights based on the percentage of value counts found within landscape components, and (2) landscape component weights based on the ratio of landscape values to the landscape area. We prepare and present maps of seven landscape values for the entire country of New Zealand to demonstrate the method. We conclude that landscape value extrapolation can assist impact assessment for land use change but should be kept simple for decision support.

AB  - Human attribution of multiple values to landscapes is not well understood owing to the variability and complexity of both the landscape concept and the human valuation process. In this study, we extend psychophysical analysis of landscapes by examining the relationships between multiple landscape values and physical landscape character. Previous landscape research has tended to focus on the relationship between a single value such as landscape aesthetics and a single physical landscape component, such as vegetation or water. We spatially intersected eight landscape values collected through a regional public participation GIS (PPGIS) process with landscape components and classes from the New Zealand Land Classification (NZLC) system. We used chi-square residual analysis and correspondence analysis to identify significant spatial associations. The results indicate that the general public associate particular values with specific landscape components at a regional scale. Greater than expected landscape values were associated with urban areas, water features, indigenous landcover, and mountains. Fewer than expected landscape values were associated with flatter, agricultural landscapes. We discuss the benefits and limitations of these methods for landscape assessment in New Zealand, and in the absence of PPGIS data to directly measure landscape values, whether landscape components should be used to interpolate values for landscape assessment. We urge replication of the method in other regions to increase the external validity of the landscape value–physical landscape associations described herein.

AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic pressures are increasingly affecting land resources, especially wetlands. This work is a contribution to the sustainable management of wetlands in Togo, particularly in the Ogou basin, which are still not been the focus of scientific investigations. The objectives of this study are to (i) map the diversity of wetlands in the Ogou River basin, and (ii) analyze the wetland habitat fragmentation at the landscape level in the study area. First, three images from Landsat 8 of 2017 and 2018 were used for wetland mapping in ENVI 4.7 software. The unsupervised classification ISODATA were used after a color composition based on neochannels (Brighness, Greeness of the Tasseled Cap and the Modified Water Detection Index (MNDWI)). Next, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to map land cover for wetland categorization. Field surveys and very high resolution Google Earth images were used to evaluate the land use and wetland mapping, using Pontius matrix which showed total discrepancies of 20% and 21% for land use and wetlands, respectively. Finally, the ''LECOS'' extension of the QGIS software was used to calculate landscape fragmentation based on landscape metrics. Two wetland types were identified according to Ramsar categorization. The “inland wetlands” (90.66%) consists of forested peatlands (33%), tree-dominated freshwater wetlands (26.68%), bush-dominated wetlands (22.14%), and non-forested peatlands (8.84%). The “artificial wetlands” (09.34%) consists of seasonally flooded agricultural land (09.32%) and water storage areas (0.03%). These wetlands make up 34.98% of the land use in the study area. The landscape metrics revealed that these wetlands are differently affected by the fragmentation process. Thus, at the global scale inland wetlands are less fragmented than artificial wetlands. However, at a more detailed scale of categorization, bush-dominated wetlands are the most fragmented on the landscape. Study results indicate that knowledge on landscape configuration will be important to monitor wetland dynamics in multifunctional areas. This study can assist in efforts towards the biological conservation and ecological restoration planning addressing wetland resources in the study area.

AB  - Agroforestry, relative to conventional agriculture, contributes significantly to carbon sequestration, increases a range of regulating ecosystem services, and enhances biodiversity. Using a transdisciplinary approach, we combined scientific and technical knowledge to evaluate nine environmental pressures in terms of ecosystem services in European farmland and assessed the carbon storage potential of suitable agroforestry systems, proposed by regional experts. First, regions with potential environmental pressures were identified with respect to soil health (soil erosion by water and wind, low soil organic carbon), water quality (water pollution by nitrates, salinization by irrigation), areas affected by climate change (rising temperature), and by underprovision in biodiversity (pollination and pest control pressures, loss of soil biodiversity). The maps were overlaid to identify areas where several pressures accumulate. In total, 94.4% of farmlands suffer from at least one environmental pressure, pastures being less affected than arable lands. Regional hotspots were located in north-western France, Denmark, Central Spain, north and south-western Italy, Greece, and eastern Romania. The 10% of the area with the highest number of accumulated pressures were defined as Priority Areas, where the implementation of agroforestry could be particularly effective. In a second step, European agroforestry experts were asked to propose agroforestry practices suitable for the Priority Areas they were familiar with, and identified 64 different systems covering a wide range of practices. These ranged from hedgerows on field boundaries to fast growing coppices or scattered single tree systems. Third, for each proposed system, the carbon storage potential was assessed based on data from the literature and the results were scaled-up to the Priority Areas. As expected, given the wide range of agroforestry practices identified, the carbon sequestration potentials ranged between 0.09 and 7.29 t C ha−1 a−1. Implementing agroforestry on the Priority Areas could lead to a sequestration of 2.1 to 63.9 million t C a−1 (7.78 and 234.85 million t CO2eq a−1) depending on the type of agroforestry. This corresponds to between 1.4 and 43.4% of European agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, promoting agroforestry in the Priority Areas would contribute to mitigate the environmental pressures identified there. We conclude that the strategic and spatially targeted establishment of agroforestry systems could provide an effective means of meeting EU policy objectives on GHG emissions whilst providing a range of other important benefits.

AB  - Temperature treatments simulated global warming effects on seedling emergence of wetland species from soil seed banks of the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Alberta, Canada. Introduced weedy species, such as Tanacetum vulgare L., had up to a 10-fold greater emergence at high temperature (30°C for 18 h with light, 15°C for 6 h in the dark) than at low temperature (20/10°C). Seedling emergence of native weedy species, such as Calamagrostis canadensis (Michx.) Beauv., was 1.5–3 times greater at low temperature. Other native weedy species, such as Rubus idaeus L., emerged only from samples at low temperature. Emergence of native non-weedy species was greatest at high temperature, even though mature plants of species such as Ranunculus hyperboreus Rottb. and Carex eburnea Boott are normally found in cool and moist habitats. Of those species expected to persist in warm and dry habitats, only introduced weedy species showed consistent and significantly greater seedling emergence at high temperature. It is hypothesized, therefore, that the abundance of introduced weedy species would increase in disturbed or sparsely vegetated zones around water bodies as these zones become dry and warm with climate change.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is defined as an important indicator in the formation and evolution of climate. In some cases, changes in landscape patterns affect LST, even more than the contribution of greenhouse gases. Although much work has been done with respect to the correlations between urban development and thermal environment dynamics, the related questions regarding relationships between LST and landscape patterns in arid regions are not thoroughly considered. Understanding these questions is important in climate change and land planning. The objective of this study was to explore the spatiotemporal variations of LST by distribution index (DI) and Mann-Kendall mutation analysis method and to quantify the relationships between landscape patterns, climatic factors, topographic factors, and the land surface thermal environment (LSTE) by the ordinary linear regressions (OLS) model. The landscape patterns dataset, which was validated by a field trip, was extracted from the Land satellite (Landsat) TM/OLI images by the Random Forest methodology in ArcGIS software. The MODIS/LST product was validated by the “Monthly dataset of China's surface climate” and a field trip. Annual LST increased by 0.54 °C (23.15 °C in 2000 and 23.79 °C in 2015). In different landscape patterns, the percentage of areas with a high level of LST showed a significant difference. In barren land, the highest area proportion for the high LST level was larger than in other landscape patterns. Meanwhile, the area of low LST was mainly concentrated in water bodies. Considerable changes have occurred in landscape patterns, in which the most noteworthy was cultivated land encroaching on grass land (3708.44 km2). The composition of landscape patterns was more important than distribution in determining the region's LST. These findings provide valuable information for land planners dealing with climate change and ecosystem conservation in arid regions.

AB  - In Canada's Arctic tundra region, permafrost is continuous, and the landscape is rich in patterned features. Polygonal terrain, which includes both high- and low-centered features and their wet trenches below, is considered to be high-latitude wetlands in the continuous permafrost region. These prominent hydrological features retain and transport water within widespread ice-wedge networks and govern many ecosystem dynamics. Due to the meter-scale spatial gradients of these processes, mapping of polygonal wetland networks necessitates high-resolution imagery. To date, most studies have used optical imagery for this task; however, these sensors are affected by cloud cover and polar darkness, limiting image availability and repeatability. Thus, our overall objective was to evaluate high-resolution hybrid compact polarimetric (HCP) imagery from the recently launched Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM), in fusion with ArcticDEM topographic data, for Arctic landscape mapping with a focus on polygonal wetlands. RCM's 5 m Stripmap beam mode, which has yet to be studied for such a task, represents an innovative HCP synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data source since it allows for polarimetric decomposition methods, despite being a dual-pol system. Within this study, we present a seven-input channel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the classification of ice-wedge dominated landscapes. A range of model hyperparameters as well as the effect of SAR speckle filtering on classification accuracy, have been examined. The optimized CNN achieved a high classification accuracy (0.931 mean Intersection Over Union; mIOU) for three semantic classes representative of the study area, namely polygonal wetlands, open water, and uplands. These results were superior in comparison to a benchmark machine learning (ML) Random Forest (RF) algorithm, thus demonstrating the proposed CNN's potential for regional-scale permafrost feature mapping. Notably, the optimal CNN architecture used unfiltered SAR data as input, underscoring the importance of spatial resolution when classifying polygonal terrain with deep learning (DL). These findings have important implications regarding the design, tuning, and sensitivity of CNN algorithms, and on the efficacy of HCP SAR, for mapping Arctic regions.

This paper critically analyzes a recent comprehensive review by Li et al., published in International Journal of Biological Macromolecules, focusing on LSP extraction, purification, and health benefits. While the original review offers valuable insights, this critique identifies opportunities to strengthen the bibliometric analysis section. This study employs a comprehensive search strategy in Scopus using specific keywords and covering a broader time frame (1975–2023), revealing 94 research articles on LSPs. The critique proposes improvements to enhance transparency and impact, such as specifying search queries and Boolean operators used across databases, detailing selection criteria, and incorporating advanced analyses. This article discusses author keyword analysis, co-citation analysis of cited authors, and bibliographic coupling analysis of documents using VOSviewer software. The global landscape mapping of LSP relationships involving authors, countries, and keywords was determined using RStudio software. These refinements will provide a more robust foundation for understanding the LSP research landscape and future research directions while also addressing common pitfalls and suggesting improvements in bibliometric analysis for future studies.

AB  - An acceleration in Sea Level Rise (SLR) and change in storm activity is likely to increase erosion and flood hazards over the coming decades, representing a significant economic burden and threat to coastal environments globally. Foredune systems may mitigate hazards by providing a natural flood protection to back barrier resources, but only if they can maintain their volume and elevation in pace with SLR and changing storm climates. The beach–dune interface, or dune toe (dt), is an important process boundary that has been used to classify and assess the resiliency of coastal landscapes, however, concerns with inconsistent methodologies have been raised in several recent works. This study provides the first comparative analysis of dt extraction methodologies, discusses the potential impacts on coastal research, and presents the Minimum Averaged Relative Relief (MARR) machine learning model aimed at improving the consistency of dt classifications. Results indicate that interannual horizontal (±29 m) and vertical positions (±1.5 m) of dt predictions are significantly different and the consistency in classifications range widely between approaches and study sites. Overall, MARR was the most consistent displaying its potential to provide an improved methodology for comparisons between sites. Over a period of decades, a disparity in the rates of change in the horizontal (±1 m/y) and vertical (±14 mm/y) dt position were also significantly different among methodologies, which can lead to a divergence in vulnerability of predicted dt elevations (−1 to +1.5 m) relative to a 1–100-year extreme sea level event by 2100. These findings suggest that studies focused on the dt may not be directly comparable, and there is a further need to improve the repeatability and transferability of all coastal landscape classifications and metrics to better inform coastal management and address uncertainties of foredune response to changing sea levels and storm climates.

AB  - The Mantiqueira Range region is one of the most important Brazilian headwater regions, from which a great number of springs flow to form one of the most important watercourses for São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais States. These natural features make the Mantiqueira Range an important hydrological region for research and development of technologies for management and environmental preservation. Areas in which the predominant land-use is native forest have proved to be strategic for groundwater recharge purposes, and thus, to mitigate drought effects that are being observed recently in Southeastern Brazil. In this context, to identify and map these areas lead to better and more successful decision making regarding soil–water conservation and management. In headwater watersheds, the knowledge about spatial distribution of soil–water transmissivity can be very important to sustainable use and conservation of environmental resources. The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of pattern recognition on landscape classification tools combined with digital soil mapping techniques for mapping soil–water transmissivity in a watershed located at one of the most important Brazilian headwaters, in Southeastern Brazil. The model used solum depth and saturated hydraulic conductivity as soil deterministic elements and topographic indexes. The results showed that the method proposed combining terrain attributes and Geomorphons, which is a mapping tool that allows for the identification of landforms within a landscape through digital elevation model analysis, was very efficient and, therefore, used to predict the soil–water transmissivity for the watershed. Areas with high to moderate soil–water transmissivity values were associated with the steepest slopes, shallow and moderately deep Inceptisols and native forest fragments. Since the relief and solum depth features of Inceptisols did not show optimal conditions for soil water percolation, the results demonstrated that land-use and management factors are crucial for groundwater recharge in the region of the Mantiqueira Range. The results also showed that areas with native forests play a fundamental role in water distribution processes in the soil profile in mountainous catchments in Southeastern Brazil. These results strengthen the importance of soil conservation practices and adequate land-use to sustain this kind of environment in Brazil.

AB  - Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China, provides critical ecological functions for water circulation and biodiversity conservation as a dynamic wetland system. However, recent climate change and human activities exerted strong pressures on this ecosystem. In this paper, we applied object-based image analysis (OBIA) and Radom Forests (RF) classifier to ten Landsat images to examine the land cover composition and its change during 1987–2017 low water season at Poyang Lake. NDVI time series (2000–2017) derived from MODIS imagery was used to document the changes of vegetation growth status. To investigate the potential driving mechanism of the inundation patterns, we differentiated the spatial-temporal changes of vegetation coverage and NDVI accumulation on eight elevation bands. Major result indicates that the vegetation area increased by 15.5% of the lake area during 1987–2017. A much faster-increasing rate (58.0 km2 year−1) can be observed during 2001–2009 as compared to that of the overall study period (18.4 km2 year−1). Analysis of NDVI accumulation showed that 42.1% of the lake's area displayed a significant increasing trend during 2000–2017. Spatially, the increase of vegetation area and NDVI accumulation mainly took place in the 11–12 m elevation band in the lower lake center. Early dry season and prolonged exposure period after the operation of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) was the major reason for the spatio-temporal evolution of the wetland vegetation in Poyang Lake. The Lake's water level started to fall below 12 m before 9th November might cause a boost of vegetation growth in the low lake center, and in turn, triggering xerophilization for the vegetation in the highlands and a shift in foraging patterns of waterbirds due to phenology variations. The findings of this study provide a clear reference for sustaining the inter-annual stability of the ecosystem by controlling the depth of water in the lake.

AB  - Land managers need new tools for planning novel futures due to climate change. Species distribution modeling (SDM) has been used extensively to predict future distributions of species under different climates, but their map products are often too coarse for fine-scale operational use. In this study we developed a flexible, efficient, and robust method for mapping current and future distributions and abundances of vegetation species and communities at the fine spatial resolutions that are germane to land management. First, we mapped Potential Vegetation Types (PVTs) using conventional statistical modeling techniques (Random Forests) that used bioclimatic ecosystem process and climate variables as predictors. We obtained over 50% accuracy across 13 mapped PVTs for our study area. We then applied future climate projections as climate input to the Random Forest model to generate future PVT maps, and used field data describing the occurrence of tree and non-tree species in each PVT category to model and map species distribution for current and future climate. These maps were then compared to two previous SDM mapping efforts with over 80% agreement and equivalent accuracy. Because PVTs represent the biophysical potential of the landscape to support vegetation communities as opposed to the vegetation that currently exists, they can be readily linked to climate forecasts and correlated with other, climate-sensitive ecological processes significant in land management, such as fire regimes and site productivity.

AB  - Rangelands are complex social-ecological systems (SES) commonly used to support ranching and other agrarian livelihoods. Common to Earth's drylands, rangelands are susceptible to drought, desertification, and land degradation from both climatic and human activities. In the arid Americas, ranching communities are often located in watersheds and rely on local riparian resources (e.g. surface- and ground-water) to support crop and animal cultivation. However, anthropogenic climate change in combination with intensified agriculture integrated into international markets degrade both landscape and water resources. In Sonora, Mexico's Río San Miguel Watershed we find via an interdisciplinary set of methods that rangeland productivity, surface-water reaches, and aquifers are reduced to critical levels, agrarian livelihoods endangered, and within this dynamic, that downstream locations are less resilient and water secure than operations upstream. This spatio-temporal dynamic to water insecurity is due both to (a) latitudinal-based climatic changes and (b) upstream groundwater pumping activity. Participatory rapid rural appraisal, agro-ecosystem analysis, and remote sensing tell us how climate, landscape, water, and ranching operation dynamics are interrelated and affect SES morphology and resilience across time, operations, and sub-watersheds. Partnerships and cooperation among ranchers, sub-watersheds, and institutions are among the management and policy interventions available to prepare for or mitigate the developing social-ecological crisis in the watershed. Lessons from Mexico's Río San Miguel Watershed are relevant for other drylands, agrarian systems, and groundwater-reliant economies, especially as the specter of long-term global climate change and water insecurity looms large for many of the Earth's social-ecological systems.

AB  - Cities play a pivotal role in achieving the global common goals for carbon peak and neutrality, encompassing energy conservation, emission reduction, sustainable utilization of urban ecosystems, and urban spatial configuration. As interest in urban contributions to climate change adaptation and mitigation intensifies, the accounting, spatial characterization, and prediction of urban carbon emissions are gaining increased attention. However, three critical challenges hinder progress: (1) the scarcity of long-term reliable data, (2) uncertainties and inconsistencies arising from fragmented carbon accounting, characterization, and prediction paradigms, and (3) the decoupling effects of socio-economic factors on carbon emissions. To address these issues, we propose an integrated research paradigm that simultaneously combines carbon emission accounting, spatial characterization, and prediction. This study comprehensively assesses the relationship between land use categories and corresponding sectoral carbon emissions across China's prefecture-level cities. An evidence-based landscape zoning system—Local Energy Zone (LEZ) is proposed, identifying significant inter-class (Mean coefficient of variation = 152 %) and intra-class (Maximum coefficient of variation = 412 %) variations in carbon source LEZ categories. Comparative analyses with multiple models and products validated LEZ's superiority in carbon emission accounting (R2 = 0.811). The pilot test conducted in Guangzhou (China) revealed that LEZ offers dual analytical benefits over other emission inventory and research paradigms by enabling comprehensive macro-level emission quantification while simultaneously facilitating precise micro-scale spatial characterization of emission patterns. This novel zoning scheme addresses the limitations of traditional carbon emission studies and offers new tools and perspectives for global urban carbon footprint and sustainable development research.

AB  - Adaptive management in arid and semi-arid regions of Patagonia, Argentina, requires a thorough understanding of vegetative dynamics, which can be obtained via rangeland assessment and monitoring. These practices are essential for decision-making to prevent environmental degradation, especially in the light of drought aggravated by climate change. In turn, most methods used to evaluate rangelands focus on data obtained from field measurements and vegetation classifications based on remote sensing data. One of the most frequent problems is that field-based rangeland assessments, based on field measurements, turn out to be expensive because they require high efforts in data collection and additionally fail to accumulate a large amount of data over time. However, satellite data series have been available for more than 20 years, which nowadays makes it possible to analyze the variation over time of vegetation productivity, and at the same time, minimize the costs. This study aimed to compare and evaluate the complementarity of information between two classification systems based on: (a) vegetation productivity dynamics derived from remote sensing data, which we have termed Rangeland Functional Archetypes, and (b) geomorphological features and field data at a farm level. We discuss the complementarity of information that can enhance rangeland assessments applied to Patagonian pastoral systems. In particular, we emphasize the opportunities to redesign management plans aimed at including dynamics and changes in time of vegetation productivity as a classificatory factor and not solely as a descriptive variable.

AB  - In Sichuan Ruoergai Wetland National Nature Reserve, the changes in landscape patterns over a period of 17years – from 1990 to 2007 – have been studied by means of RS, GIS technologies and field validation. In the reserve, the seven landscape patterns – river, lake, swamp, seasonal swamp, meadow, shrub and desert – were subject to the current study. The results show that the swamp, seasonal swamp, and meadow are the dominant landscape types occupying over 90% of the reserve’s total area. Over the past 17years, the distribution area of swamp has been decreased by 3.81%, while that of seasonal swamp and meadow has been increased by 2.58% and 2.09%, respectively. In addition, the desert area has expanded by 1.19% since 2000. The nature reserve can be characterized by patch diversity, causing landscape fragmentation over the years; the total number of patches increased to 585 from 544 and the average area of the patches decreased to 283.49hm2 from 304.29hm2 – to the detriment of the wetland functions such as carbon sink and habitats for wild animals. In the study, the causes of the alternations are discussed as mainly resulting from climate change and human disturbances such as overgrazing, drainage, and unmanaged tourism. The study results provide a scientific basis at a strategic scale for the efficient conservation and management implementation of nature reserve zoning and assessment of landscape ecological functions and conservation values.

AB  - Wetlands have long been recognized among the most critical ecosystems globally, yet their numbers quickly diminish due to human activities and climate change. Thus, large-scale wetland monitoring is essential to provide efficient spatial and temporal insights for resource management and conservation plans. However, the main challenge is the lack of enough reference data for accurate large-scale wetland mapping. As such, the main objective of this study was to investigate the efficient deep-learning models for generating high-resolution and temporally rich training datasets for wetland mapping. The Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites from the European Copernicus program deliver radar and optical data at a high temporal and spatial resolution. These Earth observations provide a unique source of information for more precise wetland mapping from space. The second objective was to investigate the efficiency of vision transformers for complex landscape mapping. As such, we proposed a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (3D GAN) to best achieve these two objectives of synthesizing training data and a Vision Transformer model for large-scale wetland classification. The proposed approach was tested in three different study areas of Saint John, Sussex, and Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. The results showed the ability of the 3D GAN to stimulate and increase the number of training data and, as a result, increase the accuracy of wetland classification. The quantitative results also demonstrated the capability of jointly using data augmentation, 3D GAN, and Vision Transformer models with overall accuracy, average accuracy, and Kappa index of 75.61%, 73.4%, and 71.87%, respectively, using a disjoint data sampling strategy. Therefore, the proposed deep learning method opens a new window for large-scale remote sensing wetland classification.

AB  - Different remote sensing techniques act as an alternative to traditional fieldwork; thereby, providing an efficient and time-saving approach to extract land use land cover (LULC) information, especially in isolated and inaccessible regions. They serve as a vital source for generating information for land resource managers and forest ecosystem conservationists. However, the major issues that determine the accuracy of such spatially explicit information are the types of data used and the choice of an appropriate classification algorithm. There's a pre-emptive need to improve algorithm-benchmarking with consensus on both LULC definitions and reference maps for their effectiveness aimed at conservation and management efforts. In this chapter, we elaborate on the classification methods available for information extraction from satellite data. As an effort of this chapter, we explore the accuracy of different classification methods in a complex heterogeneous terrain of the central Himalayan region in Asia. We explore both parametric and non-parametric classifiers to produce maps with major forest types in the study region. We recommend more directed research efforts required to reduce uncertainties of mapping methodologies, while quantifying factors affecting forest classification, especially with the integration of ancillary information and multi-source data to improve classification accuracy in a remote sensing context.

AB  - Urban geomorphology studies the landscape in cities, and changes induced by human activities to the natural landscape. Cities have different geological-geomorphological substrates, and humans as “geomorphic agents” have been operating within them in different times since the Paleolithic, threatening the Earth-surface heterogeneity and ecological sustainability, especially in urban areas. Urban geomorphology helps understanding natural and historical landscape evolution, changes to natural morphologies, and the effects of the development of cities on natural geomorphological processes. Quantitative geomorphodiversity describes the variety of landforms and morphological processes characterizing the landscape. Geomorphodiversity maps can be prepared using heterogeneous spatial data, at different geographical scales. Here, we adopt the land surface diversity index of Italy, which approximates field-based geomorphological maps. One relevant example of the latter, in Italy, is the geomorphological survey carried out in Rome, which integrates field surveys, historical maps, aerial photographs, archaeological and geomorphological literature. In this work, we compare the land surface diversity index, obtained with a simple and objective approach, with comprehensive geomorphological maps of locations describing the rural-urban gradient within the Rome urban area. We aim at understanding the representativeness of the geomorphodiversity index at the local scale, and its advantages and limitations, in urban areas. We describe a simple approach to compare the geomorphodiversity index and the geomorphological dataset. The method pins down to a common ground the five diversity classes, in the raster index, and the number of landforms mapped in the field, in the geomorphological map. Most notably, the latter distinguishes natural and anthropogenic landforms, allowing us a different assessment for these substantially different geomorphological elements. Results highlight that both natural and anthropogenic processes contribute to geomorphodiversity in urban environment, and in areas having different urbanization level. They are relevant to understand the anthropogenic morphogenesis impact on geomorphodiversity in urban environment.

AB  - National parks provide a considerable number of co-benefits to society, including the balance of ecosystems, conservation of heritage values, and tourism. However, studies on zoning approaches for the management of national parks are lacking. The landscape characterization approach is a holistic method for identifying regional landscapes and helps improve zoning management, thus promoting sustainable planning. Here, we propose a landscape character classification (LCC) approach for national parks by integrating a k-means clustering algorithm and geographic information system (GIS). We used Laoshan National Park (LNP) as a case study and aimed to (1) quantify the major landscape factors (altitude, topography relief, soil type, and heritage impact intensity) that influence the landscape classification of mountainous protected areas; (2) create a map of landscape character types and areas to guide a zoning boundary; and (3) further examine how decision makers assign different conservation strategies to each landscape character area. Our results indicate that different landscape character areas reflect distinct ecological environments and heritage values and that differentiated zoning management can effectively mitigate the impact of natural disasters and human activities. Our study suggests that national parks require scientific landscape character zoning, rational descriptions of landscape character types, and targeted management measures to achieve the dual objectives of zoning and landscape conservation.

AB  - This chapter discusses the principles and applications of geomorphological field mapping, using areas of upland terrain for example, where the presence of well-defined landforms either demonstrates ongoing geomorphic activity associated with specific process–response systems or relates to the former operation of cold climate processes associated with past climate change. In such environments, landform assemblages can be linked together through landsystems, which describe the spatial and temporal relationships of distinctive landform and sediment assemblages that correspond to different formational environments and climate regimes. Geomorphological field mapping of such landform assemblages is therefore an important technique in identifying and interpreting landscape patterns and geohazards, and determining the sensitivity of landscapes to external forcing by climate change or human activity.

AB  - Cities and urbanized regions are complex, dynamic, and highly integrated systems linking social, ecological, and technical infrastructure domains in ways that create deep challenges for good governance, policymaking, and planning. The combination of impacts from climate change in cities, air pollution, rapid population growth, multiple sources of development pressure and overall urban system complexity make it difficult for decision-makers to develop and guide development trajectories along more livable, equitable, and at the same time, more resilient pathways. Advancing urban sustainability and resilience agendas requires expanding the scope of inter- and trans-disciplinarity approaches, moving beyond the historically separate social–ecological and socio-technical approaches to jointly study social–ecological–technical infrastructure systems in cities. We take urban complexity as a given and suggest that in both research and practice we need to better capture and understand feedbacks, interdependencies, and non-linearities which create uncertainties and challenge the efficacy of governance practices to achieve normative goals for society. Here, we explore new methods, tools, and approaches to advance our understanding of urban system complexity through a series of journal special issue articles that examine urban structure–function relationships, urban sustainability transitions, green space availability, social–ecological memory, functional traits, and urban land use scenarios.

AB  - This paper demonstrated the benefits of statistical methods when investigating the climatic and non-climatic drivers responsible for variations in groundwater recharge with a series of up to 43 years of annual recharge for 426 bores in South-East South Australia. We identified the factors influencing groundwater recharge based on 71 climatic metrics and 17 non-climatic metrics (including groundwater abstraction). The results showed: (1) Rainfall during April to October was the most important variable influencing recharge temporal variation, with its decline identified as the most significant factor related to recharge reduction; (2) In contrast, a negative correlation between rainfall during December to February (DJF) and annual groundwater recharge was found. This suggests that a seasonal shift in rainfall (such as decreasing rainfall during April to October and an increase during DJF) can result in a decline in recharge even when the annual rainfall remains unchanged; (3) The length of wet spells (consecutive rain days) and increasing potential evapotranspiration (PET) were additional significant predictors for recharge temporal variation. It demonstrated that a simple empirical relationship (such as recharge as a fixed percentage of rainfall) is not a reliable estimation of renewable groundwater resources under changing climatic conditions; (4) There is a statistically significant correlation between mean groundwater depth and recharge, which implies that if groundwater level fall due to rainfall declines then a positive feedback loop can lead to further recharge declines; (5) Spatially the most statistically significant factors influencing groundwater recharge were soil types and land attributes. The findings of this study can identify which stressors should be included when investigating the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge.

AB  - Coastal wetlands such as saltmarshes support local communities and industries through ecosystem services and benefit the well-being of local communities in many regions of the world. Along sheltered temperate and sub-tropical coastlines, saltmarshes provide coastal protection, provision of recreational space and wildlife habitat. Those in northwest Europe provide a valuable resource for local agricultural communities through livestock grazing. Following the departure of the UK from the EU and the related potential changes to agricultural policies and markets, it is timely to evaluate the status of saltmarsh livestock grazing. In particular, knowledge of grazing patterns, policy futures and stakeholder perceptions are required to support traditional cultural practice and the ecological status of saltmarshes. This study focuses on the devolved UK nation of Wales, as it has a strong traditional agricultural and pastoral economy, and a landscape of significant conservation value. Yet there are substantial evidence and knowledge gaps regarding livestock grazing and its saltmarsh impact. We present the first map showing the spatial distribution of saltmarsh grazing practice in the UK. Drawing on insights gathered through an expert workshop and interviews with saltmarsh landowners and managers across Wales (N = 35), the paper discusses the challenges and benefits of coastal grazing on saltmarshes, highlighting the diverse values, personal connection and sense of identity associated with marshes. Interviews reveal deep rooted social and cultural values attributed to saltmarshes by the rural coastal community. The study illustrates the need for an integrated approach to management of saltmarshes, accounting for the social, cultural, economic, and environmental values within decision-making.

AB  - Abstract
Cirques are complex landforms resulting from glacial erosion and can be used to estimate Equilibrium Line Altitudes and infer climate history. Automated extraction of cirquesmay help research on glacial geomorphology and climate change. Our objective was to test the transferability of an object-based rule set for the extraction of glacial cirques, using lidar data and color-infrared orthophotos. In Vorarlberg (W-Austria), we selected one training area with well-developed cirque components to parameterize segmentation and classification criteria. The rule set was applied to three test areas that are positioned in three altitudinal zones. Results indicate that the rule set was successful (81 percent) in the training area and a higher situated area (71 percent). Accuracy decreased in the two lower situated test areas (66 percent and 51 percent). We conclude that rule sets are transferable to areas with a comparable geomorphological history. Yet, significant deviation from the training area requires a different extraction strategy.

AB  - Agroecological and technological innovations are two important approaches in the transition towards agricultural sustainability. We lack knowledge about how current agricultural contexts may influence future development pathways and the relative importance of the two approaches. This study explores the alignment between past uptake of agroecological and technological practices and future visions of agricultural development in seven European arable farming systems. By combining landscape mapping with farmer interviews, we first assessed the past adoption of agroecological and technological practices in each region. Then, we compared our findings with expert surveys about the future directions of agricultural development that can address local arable farming challenges. We found that in regions with intensive arable farming, agroecological approaches lagged behind the uptake of technological measures, both in the past and in future prospects. In low-intensity regions, we found large gaps between past uptake and future prospects of agroecological and technological practice adoption. These gaps need to be overcome in the context of future challenges of climate change adaptation and of environmental obligations. Our results indicate the need to take differentiated measures depending on farm management intensity and landscape conditions to enhance the future uptake of agroecological and technological solutions that can address the local challenges.

AB  - Scenarios are increasingly used for envisioning future social-ecological changes and consequences for human well-being. One approach integrates qualitative storylines and biophysical models to explore potential futures quantitatively and maximize public engagement. However, this integration process is challenging and sometimes oversimplified. Using the Yahara Watershed (Wisconsin, USA) as a case study, we present a transparent and reproducible roadmap to develop spatiotemporally explicit biophysical inputs [climate, land use/cover (LULC), and nutrients] that are consistent with scenario narratives and can be linked to a process-based biophysical modeling suite to simulate long-term dynamics of a watershed and a range of ecosystem services. Our transferrable approach produces daily weather inputs by combining climate model projections and a stochastic weather generator, annual narrative-based watershed-scale LULC distributed spatially using transition rules, and annual manure and fertilizer (nitrogen and phosphorus) inputs based on current farm and livestock data that are consistent with each scenario narrative.

AB  - Wildfires represent a major concern for the forests in the Mediterranean basin regions since global climate change enhances the frequency and the severity of this natural ecological disturbance agent. Wildfire models (fire spread or fire behavior models) can be of valuable help for fire risk assessment as well as for planning mitigation actions which mainly concern forest management. These models need generalized vegetation (fuel) data sets at the scales which are significant for fire/forest management. However, despite of the efforts to develop methods for generating global fuel data sets, there is a lack of fine resolution regional scale fuel data sets for the Mediterranean basin. The aim of this work is to build a fuel data set based on existing data sources for fire/forest management, risk assessment and decision-support purposes. Thus, this paper presents a database (building methods and data) of wildland fuels for Mediterranean basin vegetation stands types and in particular for those in Corsica, which gathers together most common input parameters needed by wildfire’s models at several vegetation scales (i.e., stand, elements, particles). Moreover, an example is provided where simulations are run with a specific wildfire model by using the fuel input data extracted from the database. Fuel attributes have been defined to be meaningful at regional/landscape scales and are representative of stand-level characteristics. National (French) Forest Inventory (NFI) data have been mainly used for determining the fuel attributes for forest stand types. The harmonization of European NFIs generates a reliable data source available to extend and generalize the methodology presented herein to other regions or countries.

AB  - Mediterranean rural landscapes are experiencing multiple changes which imperil the preservation of landscape pattern and character. Despite the abundance of land-use change studies, most approaches do not evaluate the impact of land-use change on landscape character. This study presents a diagnostic framework focused on two main phases: i) the quantification of landscape pattern and analysis of the significant transition processes that occur, and ii) a qualitative appraisal of land-use transitions, classifying them based on whether the landscape character is maintained, neglected, enhancing, or diverging. Four land-use maps from 1995, 2007, 2010 and 2015 covering the Douro region (northeastern Portugal) were analyzed. This region has heterogeneous landscape characters and includes areas classified for their natural and cultural values. Most of the change was compatible with the landscape character (87%), though there was a reduction in heterogeneous agriculture, bare land, and pastureland associated with agricultural abandonment. Landscape patches were more complex and less isolated until 2007, but there has been an opposite trend in recent years. The main change processes are afforestation, loss of forests, and vineyard expansion. The Douro region shows similar trends to other Mediterranean areas, namely the polarization of human influence, driven mainly by depopulation, agricultural policies and wildfires. In conclusion, this diagnostic framework quantified and spatialized the main trends, constituting the first step to analyzing a vast and heterogeneous territory. This study emphasizes the importance of monitoring this landscape in the future to make better-informed decisions regarding landscape planning and maintenance to address challenges such as climate change and depopulation.

AB  - Large-scale anthropic conversion of natural ecosystems into human-dominated countryside ecosystems has led to biodiversity loss worldwide. However, how countryside landscapes affect biodiversity is still controversial, especially in karst regions lack of relevant studies. To answer this question, we analyzed the impact of countryside landscapes on biodiversity changes in the South China Karst, featured as a World Natural Heritage site of subtropical karst landscape and rich biodiversity. We presented a new framework to examine the impact of countryside landscapes on biodiversity change at a semi centennial-scale using three indicators: biodiversity cluster characteristics, the barrier of villages to biodiversity, and the barrier of arable land to biodiversity. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, satellite remote sensing data, and field survey data were combined during the process. Results revealed that plant biodiversity was positively correlated to vegetation restoration, and vegetation took approximately 80 years to recover to a stable state. Plant biodiversity spatial points are densely distributed at karst peaks, with an average distance of only 420 m–480 m. Small villages create no apparent barriers to biodiversity, with an average barrier distance of about 450 m–530 m. Arable land intersecting with forest patches connects biodiversity spatial points. Hence, the expansion of countryside landscapes in karst depressions was restricted by karst peaks, and patches of artificial arable land and forest connect the natural reserved forest at karst peaks, which both promote local spatial heterogeneity and sustain local biodiversity. This study enriches the application of countryside biogeography theory in karst regions and provides evidence for integrating biodiversity conservation into sustainable planning in broader areas. We strongly recommend that a heterogeneous landscape pattern similar to karst peak forests, such as the distance between biodiversity spatial points and the barrier distance to villages both around 450–500 m, would be conducive to biodiversity preservation.

AB  - Summary
The coastal counties of Zhejiang Province, China, are important for economic development, marine economy, and nature conservation. This study aimed to support sustainable land-use policies through the planning and management of 35 counties, using official land-use data from 1990 to 2020. Spatial analysis methods included transition matrix, land-use intensity, landscape-pattern indices, centroid shift, and standard deviation ellipses. Results showed a “north-cropland, south-woodland” structure, together over 75% of the area. Construction land expanded steadily to 20%, mainly from cropland, woodland, and grassland (87% of outflows). Inflows mainly involved construction land, woodland, and cropland (91%). The wetland was dominated by the river channel and mudflat. Mudflat and beach made up 94% of outflows; reservoir and pond, 78% of inflows. Land-use intensity increased overall, with Pinghu highest. Grassland centroid shifted 38.74 km. Ellipses showed directional changes. Land-use diversity and spatial complexity increased, reflecting intensified human influence and offering a basis for sustainable planning and ecological restoration.

AB  - Balanced conservation strategies are needed to ensure the protection of wetlands in the twenty-first century. To guarantee the success of wetland restoration projects, it is essential to better understand the characteristics of these fragile sites and the driving mechanisms of change. This study characterised the morphology of wetland platforms at five backbarrier sites distributed around the world and subject to various tidal regimes (micro- to macrotidal). Wetland ecogeomorphologic units were manually mapped and classified into upper-, mid-low marsh, tidal flat and channel, using high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Differences in elevation, slope and hydroperiod metrics between morphological units and study sites were assessed, as well as the influence of tidal range and associated inundation patterns on wetland zonation. Upper and mid-low marshes showed steeper intra-slopes compared to channels and tidal flats, with the latter exhibiting longer hydroperiods. No significant differences in normalised elevation and hydroperiod were detected between study sites. Steeper slopes were observed in microtidal systems compared to meso- and macrotidal systems, likely due to constrained horizontal migration. These findings enhance the understanding of the regional patterns of wetland morphological succession, and highlight that tidal range is not the primary driver of spatial variability in wetland zonation. Moreover, this baseline dataset of morphological thresholds can be used to support future large-scale comparisons and inform sustainable management strategies for coastal wetlands, particularly in the context of climate change. Future studies should analyse additional landscape metrics (e.g., vegetation density, sediment accretion rates) and evaluate the cumulative effects of site-specific drivers on wetland geometry.

AB  - The capacity of a plantation forest to grow and produce timber is locally constrained by topography, climate, soil conditions, and external factors such as fire and timber harvesting. Accurate estimation of forest productivity supports effective forest management. However, efficiently generating accurate models of forest productivity is hampered by the need to gather, process and integrate large volumes of disparate, high dimensional data that require computationally intensive data analysis processing methods. Recent developments in cloud-based machine learning systems offer a means to address this problem. This research investigates the use of supervised machine learning to model and predict forest productivity across pine (Pinus radiata) plantations in northern Tasmania, Australia. Forest productivity models are generated by integrating 23 predictive features, including multi-temporal LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) derived topographic attributes, climate (rainfall and temperature) information, and edaphic conditions (geology and soil). Five machine learning (ML) regression algorithms are compared for this task: Linear Regression (LR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Decision Trees Regression (DT), Random Forests (RF) and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees Regression (GBDT). The best performing algorithm, in terms of the optimal bias-variance trade-off, was RF (RMSE 2.08 and Bias −0.72) followed closely by GBDT (RMSE 2.13 and Bias −0.68) and DT (RMSE 2.94 and Bias −0.68). Tuning Model Complexity was used to provide a clear understanding of the relationship and interactions between input features and forest productivity, resulting in more accurate and interpretable models. In contrast, we conclude that GBDT results in a more reliable predictive performance than RF, and transferability model to unseen data by assessing the spatial autocorrelation. Across the top performing models, rainfall was the most important factor driving forest productivity, followed by geological class, topographic position index (TPI), landscape aspect and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). This work demonstrates the usefulness of supervised machine learning techniques to generate accurate and efficient forest productivity predictions from large and diverse spatial datasets. Moreover, users are afforded the ability to gain insight into changes that affect forest productivity through time, such as the increasing risks of wildfire and climate change by identifying the factors that contribute the most to the tree growth. By delivering a framework to understand complex and dynamic drivers of productivity through a machine learning pipeline enhanced by cloud-based machine learning systems, forest managers are provided with easily accessible tools to maximisation productivity.

AB  - Climate change and landscape fragmentation are considered to be the main treats to biodiversity. In this study, probable alteration of future species distribution was tested based on the association of landscape fragmentation and climate change scenarios compared to the classical approach that assumed an unchanged landscape. Also, projected range shifts including realistic dispersal scenarios were compared with classical models, in which no or full dispersal has been supposed. A GIS-based cellular automata model, MigClim, was implemented to projection of future distribution over the 21st century for three plant species in a study area of the central Germany. For each species, simulations were run for four dispersal scenarios (full dispersal, no dispersal, realistic dispersal, and realistic dispersal with long-distance dispersal events), two landscape fragmentation (static and dynamic change) and two climate change (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios. In this research, temporal satellite data were utilized to simulate landscape changes by the use of a hybrid (CA-Markov) model for the years 2020, 2040, 2060 and 2080. A significant difference appears to be between the simulations of realistic dispersal limitations and those considering full or no dispersal for projected future distributions. Although simulations accounting for dispersal limitations produced, for our study area, results that were closer to no dispersal than to full dispersal. Additionally, our results revealed that change in landscape fragmentation is more effective than the climate change impacts on species distributions in this study.

AB  - The Yarlung Zangbo-Brahmaputra River originates from the Tibetan Plateau. Its hydraulic conditions and ecological environment affect the economic, agricultural development and ecological environmental protection of many countries. So far, studies analyzing the impacts of potential climate change on hydrological and water resources conditions in the Yarlung Zangbo-Brahmaputra River Basin are limited. Most of these studies analyzed the overall basin condition at the large and coarse scale. Research on the response of the topography and ecological environment at high spatial resolution scale in river reaches and wetlands to climate change in this area has not been conducted before. In this study, we developed a two-dimensional flow-sediment transport model to simulate the flow and sediment conditions in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo-Brahmaputra River with the hydrological conditions predicted by a meteorological-hydrological model. We then analyzed the impacts of potential climate change on the riverbed and wetland topography in this region. We further designed a habitat suitability evaluation system to evaluate and compare the ecological environment of the wetland under current climate conditions and with potential climate change. Our research shows that climate change scenario RCP4.5 will result in about 40–90 million cubic meters of sediment deposition in wetlands each year in the next 6 years. The elevation of the main channel will decrease, while the elevation of shoals will increase, which will indirectly lead to wetland degradation. The difficulty of foraging will be increased, and the area available for fish to rest will decrease. Ultimately, the habitat environment of fish will be destroyed and the density of fish populations will be lower. The impact on migratory birds is more complicated. It is expected that the migratory birds' living environment will improve in July (since both selected habitat suitability metrics show a trend of improvement), but it will be worse than the current condition in other months.

AB  - Effective climate change adaptation planning requires evaluating the interplay of physical landscape characteristics and community perceptions of places. Geographic information system (GIS)-based approaches to measuring environmental values can identify locations for planning prioritization. But they seldom are used to consider spatial differences in socio-ecological worldview. This study aims to identify how place-based risk perceptions and landscape values can inform climate change adaptation using a Q+PPGIS method. We integrated mapped landscape values and climate risks (from 39 PPGIS participants) with elicited discourses (for 28 Q-method participants) to develop a novel land classification approach (reflexive Q+PPGIS). The results demonstrate significant differences between wilderness as a discourse and perceived, and the physical features associated with mapped wild areas. Similar differences in discourse and spatial patterns are observed for climate risks. For example, participants’ mapped areas of bushfire risk do not align with agencies’ identified risk areas, their jurisdictions, and capacities to take action. This disconnect presents a challenge to adaptation. Local governments can use this new method to show constituents multiple and often competing community demands for action, enabling honest conversations about feasible actions, responsibilities, and resource allocation.

AB  - Microwave imagery has a distinct advantage over optical imagery in high-latitude areas because it allows data to be acquired independently of cloud cover and solar illumination. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based monitoring has become increasingly important for understanding the state and dynamics of permafrost landscapes at the regional scale. This study presents a permafrost landscape mapping method that uses multi-temporal TerraSAR-X backscatter intensity and interferometric coherence information. The proposed method can classify permafrost landscape features and map the two most important features in sub-arctic permafrost environments: permafrost-affected areas and thermokarst ponds. First, a land cover map is generated through the combined use of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. An overall accuracy of 98% is achieved when classifying rock and water bodies, and an accuracy of 79% is achieved when discriminating between different vegetation types with one year of single-polarized acquisitions. Second, the distributions of the permafrost-affected areas and thermokarst ponds are derived from the classified landscapes. Permafrost-affected areas are inferred from the relationship between vegetation cover and the existence of permafrost, and thermokarst pond distributions are directly inherited from the land cover map. The two mapped features exhibit good agreement with manually delineated references. The proposed method can produce permafrost landscape maps in complex sub-arctic environments and improve our understanding of the effects of climate change on permafrost landscapes. This classification strategy can be transferred to other time-series SAR datasets, e.g., Sentinel-1, and other heterogeneous environments.

AB  - Over the last century, lands used for livestock and agriculture have been progressively abandoned on mountains across Europe. The afforestation of abandoned agricultural lands leads to significant environmental impacts particularly in karst catchments, which are highly responsive to climate change and human disturbances. Due to the lack of long-term historical records and appropriate methods, these impacts are not yet well investigated. The remote Baget forested catchment (Pyrenees Mountains), where a long-term hydrochemical survey has been conducted since 1979, was chosen to develop a method for reconstructing the evolution of landscapes based on heterogeneous and multi-temporal satellite imagery and aerial photographs from 1942 onwards. An indicator of landscape change is proposed, based on three vegetation groups, compatible with the various supporting data. The spatio-temporal landscape evolution evidenced a regular increase of 31% in forest extension between 1942 and 2019, while pioneer (grassland and heathlands) and open forest (early woodland) stages showed an overall but uneven decrease, marked by an accelerated decline of the latter due to an increase in livestock activities. The trends of streamwater discharge and chemistry were related to these environmental changes. A set of processes influencing the changes in the hydrochemical patterns, particularly the increase in dissolved elements in streamwater originating from carbonate dissolution, is proposed and discussed. The forest recolonization (+0.05 Km2.yr−1) enhanced soil organic matter content, generating an increased pCO2 in soils, which in turn enhanced the carbonate dissolution, expressed by a concentration increase of + 5 μeq.L-1.yr−1 for (Ca2++Mg2+) and of + 10 μeq.L-1.yr−1 for HCO3–. The steeper slope of HCO3– could result from decreasing terrestrial Ca2++Mg2+ export together with decreasing SO42- leaching (−4 μeq.L-1.yr−1) due to decreasing acid atmospheric deposition. In the meantime, the observed increase in air temperature (+0.03 °C.yr−1) favoured tree growth, litter decomposition and water demand by trees. This study has demonstrated the powerful indicator of linking the historical evolution of the landscape, quantified using images, to the observed trends in the hydrochemical composition of stream waters, to highlight the internal processes of the critical zone. However, because of nested effects, it still remains a challenge to strictly quantify their respective impact on streamwater chemistry.

AB  - Accurate crop distribution mapping is required for crop yield prediction and field management. Due to rapid progress in remote sensing technology, fine spatial resolution (FSR) remotely sensed imagery now offers great opportunities for mapping crop types in great detail. However, within-class variance can hamper attempts to discriminate crop classes at fine resolutions. Multi-temporal FSR remotely sensed imagery provides a means of increasing crop classification from FSR imagery, although current methods do not exploit the available information fully. In this research, a novel Temporal Sequence Object-based Convolutional Neural Network (TS-OCNN) was proposed to classify agricultural crop type from FSR image time-series. An object-based CNN (OCNN) model was adopted in the TS-OCNN to classify images at the object level (i.e., segmented objects or crop parcels), thus, maintaining the precise boundary information of crop parcels. The combination of image time-series was first utilized as the input to the OCNN model to produce an ‘original’ or baseline classification. Then the single-date images were fed automatically into the deep learning model scene-by-scene in order of image acquisition date to increase successively the crop classification accuracy. By doing so, the joint information in the FSR multi-temporal observations and the unique individual information from the single-date images were exploited comprehensively for crop classification. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was investigated using multitemporal SAR and optical imagery, respectively, over two heterogeneous agricultural areas. The experimental results demonstrated that the newly proposed TS-OCNN approach consistently increased crop classification accuracy, and achieved the greatest accuracies (82.68% and 87.40%) in comparison with state-of-the-art benchmark methods, including the object-based CNN (OCNN) (81.63% and 85.88%), object-based image analysis (OBIA) (78.21% and 84.83%), and standard pixel-wise CNN (79.18% and 82.90%). The proposed approach is the first known attempt to explore simultaneously the joint information from image time-series with the unique information from single-date images for crop classification using a deep learning framework. The TS-OCNN, therefore, represents a new approach for agricultural landscape classification from multi-temporal FSR imagery. Besides, it is readily generalizable to other landscapes (e.g., forest landscapes), with a wide application prospect.

AB  - The development of island landscape space is restricted by its eco-environmental vulnerability and ecosystem complexity. Focusing on the water-land ecotone in the southern part of Chongming Island, this study explored a multidimensional holistic assessment method of island landscape by referring to methods of Landscape Character Assessment (LCA), assisting decision-making in island land use management. This study established a system comprising 12 factors of island landscape characteristics from 3 dimensions: nature, humanity, and coastal pressure. Both qualitative and quantitative methods of fishnet network, spatial overlay, and artificial boundary recognition were used to identify island landscape character types. The results show that there are 6 landscape zones at the local scale, 18 landscape character subtypes, and 87 landscape character partitions at the site scale. Finally, suggestions for improvement of each landscape character zone were made in terms of landscape improvement, island ecological security and, especially, landscape environmental governance, to provide direction for the sustainable development and utilisation of island landscape resources.

AB  - The scale and impacts of changes to beaches due to natural hazards, human use, economic development, tectonic uplift and subsidence, and climate change, especially, sea level rise and storm surges can generate persistent as well as temporary beach forms that are important to tourism, animal behavior, and conservation of diverse and fragile ecosystems. Vegetated and nonvegetated coastal areas are critical transition zones between land, freshwater habitats, lagoons, wetlands, residential communities, and tourist services as well as the marine nearshore and open ocean. Beaches and their associated environments provide essential ecosystem goods and services, including shoreline protection, nutrient cycling, fisheries resources, habitat and food, and regulation of nutrients, water, sand particles, and organisms. Sandy beaches, in particular, are an essential element of coastal geomorphology, and in the Galapagos Islands, they are critical sites for animal and human uses and interactions. As such, the preservation and management of sandy beaches are important and their sustainability crucial for island ecosystem sustainability. In this article, we describe a beach vulnerability framework to assess the Galapagos Islands, and the fusion of remote sensing data and measurement methods associated with high spatial resolution remote systems for beach assessments of sensitive and fragile settings.

AB  - Ongoing land clearing is a key driver of biodiversity loss and climate change. Effective action to halt land clearing and land degradation ultimately relies on understanding patterns of land capability for production uses, in particular agriculture, as a key driver of land use. Here we describe a national agricultural land capability map for Australia, based on harmonized state agricultural land capability datasets and modelled pastoral capability. State-level agricultural land capability datasets capture regional variations in crop selection and suitability. Hence, we reclassified these datasets to fit a nationally consistent land capability ranking scheme. For regions in which agricultural capability data was not available, we modelled agricultural and pastoral capability and mapped this to the same ranking scheme. The national land capability dataset fills an immediate knowledge need for Australia. This dataset has wide potential for utilization, such as for retrospective analysis of land use policies and prospective regional planning initiatives to ensure forward looking policies and land use plans optimize land allocation.

AB  - The effects of hydrologic cycle change (caused by human activity and global climate change) on ecosystems attract the increasing attention around the world. As a result of impounding of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), climate change and sand mining, the dry season of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake (China’s two largest freshwater lakes) came early after the TGD impoundment. It was the primary cause of the increasing need for sluice/dam construction to store water in the Lakes and attracted increasing attention. In this paper, we compared the landscape pattern between three hydrologic years with early dry season (EY) and three normal hydrologic years (NY) of each lake by remote sensing technology, to reveal the effect of early dry season on landscape pattern. The results showed that early dry season caused expanding of Phalaris to mudflat zone in Poyang Lake, while caused expanding of Carex to Phalaris zone and expanding of Phalaris to mudflat zone in Dongting Lake. In landscape level, there was no significant difference in landscape grain size, landscape grain shape, habitat connectivity and landscape diversity between EY and NY in the two lakes. While in habitat class level, there were significant changes in area of mudflat and Phalaris and grain size of mudflat in Poyang Lake, and in area of Carex, grain size of Phalaris and grain shape of Carex and Phalaris in Dongting Lake. These changes will impact migrating birds of East Asian and migratory fishes of Yangtze River.

AB  - The Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO), Melville Island, Nunavut (74°55′N, 109°34′W) was established in 2003 to examine Arctic ecosystem processes that would be impacted by climate warming and permafrost degradation. This paper provides a synthesis of how remote sensing has contributed to biogeophysical modelling and monitoring at the CBAWO from 2003 to 2023. Given the location and isolated nature of the CBAWO in the Canadian High Arctic, remote sensing data and derivatives have been instrumental for studies examining ecosystem structure and function at local and landscape scales. In combination with field measurements, remote sensing data facilitated mapping and modelling of vegetation types, % vegetation cover and aboveground phytomass, soil moisture, carbon exchange rates, and permafrost degradation and disturbance. It has been demonstrated that even in an environment with limited vegetation cover and phytomass, spectral vegetation indices (e.g., the normalized difference vegetation index) are able to model various biogeophysical variables. These applications are feasible for research sites such as the CBAWO using high spatial resolution remote sensing data across the visible, infrared, and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Furthermore, as the satellite record continues to expand, we will gain a greater understanding of the impacts arising from the expected continued warming at northern latitudes. Although the logistics for research in the Arctic remain challenging, today's technologies (e.g., high spatial resolution satellite remote sensing, automated in situ sensors and data loggers, and wireless communication systems) can support a host of scientific endeavours in the Arctic (and other remote sites) through modelling and monitoring of biogeophysical variables and Earth surface processes with limited but critical field campaigns. The research synthesized here for the CBAWO highlights the essential role of remote sensing of terrestrial ecosystems in the Canadian Arctic.

AB  - In the 21st century, global warming, erratic rainfall and the pressure on groundwater resources are becoming severe and leading to water scarcity, which contributes to the poverty of around one-third of the world's people. Hence, it became necessary to use new geospatial technologies for mapping and monitoring of groundwater resources. Spatial analysis of hydro-geological lineament network and hydrological modeling may allow accurate identification of areas that favor infiltration and recharge of overexploited groundwater. In Morocco, the Middle Atlas region suffers from a lack of reliable hydro-geological maps for local water resource managers. Consequently, this research aims to assess the relative contribution of the topo-hydrological factor, known as Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) for efficient exploration and management of groundwater resources in central Middle Atlas. The methodology was based on the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for retrieving the lineaments and the elevation data from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) for the calculation of the HAND model. Four landscape classes namely, waterlogged land, wetlands sloped, hillslope and plateaus, corresponding to the main hydrological systems, were delineated using the HAND model. In addition, fissured carbonate plateaus, faults, karsts, water sources, lakes and groundwater levels have been used to develop a decision support system based on geospatial criteria analysis. The fracture analysis indicated that the study area has many long and short hydro-geological lineaments, with the highest densities oriented NE–SW. Their synergy with the HAND model and the other factors has allowed the detection of potential areas for the recharge of the groundwater table. The results have been confirmed and validated using lakes, water sources and piezometric levels. The application of the HAND factor as an independent variable in the delineation of groundwater potential areas (GPAs) is demonstrated to be useful for improving the accuracy of the existing multi-criteria GIS models.

AB  - Lakes in Central Asia, characterized largely by a semiarid climate and delicate ecosystems, are quite sensitive and vulnerable to climate change but remain less exploited, due mostly to a lack of in-situ measurements. Lake ice phenology is an essential climate variable identified by the Global Climate Observation System. To overcome the overestimation of clouds by the MODIS cloud mask, we developed and distributed a two-step Random Forest algorithm based on MODIS data on the Google Earth Engine. This algorithm first distinguishes cloudy pixels from non-cloudy pixels, and then ice pixels are discriminated from non-cloudy pixels using additional thermal infrared information. We validated the algorithm by implementing it over several boreal lakes with in-situ records in North America and compared our results with existing lake ice phenology datasets. We subsequently retrieved lake ice phenology for 20 large lakes (> 100 km2) in Central Asia from 2001 to 2021 and examined trends in lake ice phenology over this period. On average, lakes in Central Asia underwent later freezing at 0.13 d/yr, earlier thawing at 0.32 d/yr, and shorter ice duration at 0.45 d/yr, with over half of the lakes witnessing significant trends in at least one ice phenology indicator. To evaluate the impact of meteorological factors on lake ice phenology, we built a linear mixed model that predicts ice phenology using meteorological variables from ERA5. Daily mean air temperature dominates ice phenology, with mean air temperature during October to June in the following year explaining approximately 35% of the variance of the duration between freezing and thawing for each lake. Our study offers a comprehensive analysis of lake ice phenology in Central Asia under climate change.

AB  - Terraces and lynchets are ubiquitous worldwide and can provide increasingly important Ecosystem Services (ESs), which may be able to mitigate aspects of climate change. They are also a major cause of non-linearity between climate and erosion rates in agricultural systems as noted from alluvial and colluvial studies. New research in the ‘critical zone’ has shown that we must now treat soil production as an ecologically sensitive variable with implications for soil carbon sequestration. In this review and synthesis paper we present a modified classification of agricultural terraces, review the theoretical background of both terraces and lynchets, and show how new techniques are transforming the study of these widespread and often ancient anthropogenic landforms. The problems of dating terraces and the time-consuming nature of costly surveys have held back the geomorphological and geoarchaeological study of terraces until now. The suite of techniques now available, and reviewed here, includes Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) - Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, Airborne and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (ALS-TLS); optically stimulated luminescence (OSL and pOSL), portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF), Fourier-transform infra-red analysis (FTIR), phytoliths from plants, and potentially environmental DNA. Three process-related geomorphological questions arise from using this suite of methods; a) can they provide both a chronology of formation and use history, b) can we identify the sources of all the soil components? c) Can terrace soil formation and ecosystem services be modelled at the slope to catchment scale? The answers to these questions can also inform the management of the large areas of abandoned and under-used terraces that are resulting from both the economics of farming and rural population changes. Where possible, examples are drawn from a recently started ERC project (TerrACE; ERC-2018-2023; https://www.terrace.no/) that is working at over 15 sites in Europe ranging from Norway to Greece.

AB  - The assessment of ecosystem service losses is crucial for ecological impact assessment and the practice of ecological compensation restoration projects. However, few studies on assessing losses have focused on ecosystem services, and the existing knowledge is fragmented. This review synthesizes the research status, methods, and key findings in the field. It outlines the research status by categorizing studies into human, natural and comprehensive disturbance assessments by disturbance events. A basic framework for future research is established by summarizing assessment procedures and methods. Comparisons of the magnitude of losses and analyses of driving factors in existing studies have been discussed, and recommendations for future research directions have been proposed. Research indicates that since 2010, studies related to this topic have gradually increased, with a predominant focus on the losses caused by human disturbance. Regulatory services are the most frequently assessed type. Most results suggest that the magnitude of losses varies across different types of ecosystem services, ecosystems, and stages of ecosystem degradation. The regularity of these losses remains to be explored. Land use and climate change are two major driving factors, and distinguishing between their impacts is crucial. Therefore, future research should enhance assessments at multiple scales, promote more accurate assessments from aspects of data acquisition and evaluation methods, and deepen the exploration of loss regularity and drivers. This review fills the gap in systematic understanding of ecosystem service losses, offering a comprehensive reference for further research and the establishment of standards for ecological restoration and compensation.

AB  - Planning for sustainable land management and the development of land classification systems has become a very complex process with the increasing sophistication of GIS techniques. This has resulted in the emphasis moving to detailed micro-scale description and planning, with a loss of perception of the physical processes and hierarchy of constraints that control local activities. We have developed a meso-scale climate-landscape classification technique which would enable policy makers to develop simplified guidelines for rural activities and to help landholders identify appropriate sustainable land uses. It would also provide a simplified tool for assessment of the effectiveness of a protected areas network. We propose that unless the basic physical possibilities and limitations of the environment are properly understood it is not possible to have sustainable land management, nor stay within the carrying capacity of the local environment.

AB  - Advanced remote sensing technology provides data to help address these growing information needs and support further models develop and parameterize for an even wider array of information needs. The present chapter aims to review the recent remote sensing developments in a chronological application of forest resources and analyze geospatial intelligence for future forestry research. In this context, we examine the possibility of advanced remote sensing technologies having the greatest impact on forest inventories designed to define strategic, tactical, and operational information about forest resources: airborne laser scanning, terrestrial laser scanning, digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP), and high-spatial resolution (HSR)/very HSR. A number of key aspects are then discussed, including the definition of key terms, the reasons for local people to participate (or hesitate to participate) in forest resource assessment, and the various techniques that may be used by or with local people in forest assessment. We articulate views on the quality, resolution, expansion, and inclusion of knowledge of the genetic structure of tree species, along with the use of models of site production of forestry management, in terms of adaptation to climate change scenarios.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to introduce a statistical concept to derive ecological classifications of terrestrial and marine environments. Such ecological regionalisations reflect spatial combinations of biotic and abiotic characteristics and therefore may serve for environmental planning and monitoring issues. Referring to two case studies the paper presents how to calculate and map ecological defined regions from geodata by use of decision tree models and GIS-techniques. The first study deals with marine environments, exemplified by benthic habitats in the North Sea. The second study is on an ecological land classification of Europe which was computed using surface data on potential natural vegetation, elevation, soil texture and several climatic elements. Both the marine and the terrestrial ecoregions maps were combined with exposure data provided by environmental monitoring activities. The ecological land classification of Europe was intersected with measurement data on the metal loads in mosses taken from the German part of UN ECE moss surveys. In this way, the temporal development of the metal bioaccumulation within ecoregions since 1990 was assessed. The benthic habitat map was used to regionalise the temporal trend of the temperature conditions near the sea floor for the months of July and January from 1995 to 2000 by analysing these measurements according to the spatial categories of the habitat map. In the future, both ecological regionalisations should be used as a spatial framework for the analysis of up-to-date meteorological and phenological data in order to disclose climate change induced impacts.

AB  - We have developed a new hierarchical European Landscape Classification that can be used as a framework for, e.g., indicator reporting and environmental sampling. Landscapes are ecological meaningful units where many processes and components interact. And as such, landscapes themselves have resulted from long-term interactions of natural abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic processes. A good understanding of landscapes is essential for its assessment, protection, management and planning. An internationally consistent approach is therefore obligatory and the production of landscape classifications and associated maps is an important tool in this context. Although intuitive maps are available there are no consistent quantitative maps of European landscapes. In this paper, landscapes are regarded as forming recognizable parts of the earth's surface and as showing a characteristic ordering of elements. The complex nature of the underlying scientific concepts, which sometimes overlap and conflict, requires an objective and consistent methodology, as described in the present paper. As there are many regional differences in landscape properties, it is crucial to strike the right balance between reducing the inherent complexity and maintaining an adequate level of detail. Against this background, a European Landscape Map (LANMAP) has been produced, making use of available segmentation and classification techniques on high-resolution spatial data sets. LANMAP is a landscape classification of Pan-Europe with four hierarchical levels; using digital data on climate, altitude, parent material and land use as determinant factors; and has 350 landscape types at the most detailed level. At this level there are 14,000 mapping units with a minimum mapping unit of 11km2. Thus far, LANMAP is limited to a biophysical approach, since there is a lack of consistent and European-wide data on cultural–historical factors. This paper describes the conceptual background of LANMAP, its methodology and results, and shows its potentials and limitations.

AB  - Ecosystems in drylands regions provide numerous services that support climate change adaptation, but both natural and human factors have massively degraded these ecosystems, jeopardising their capacity to provide critical services. Promoting sustainable management of these ecosystems is imperative for successful adaptation in such regions. However, the lack of spatially explicit and detailed information about ecosystems and their services hinders effective management and climate adaptation strategies. This study investigated the spatial distribution of ecosystems and their potential to provide key services along a dryland gradient in the Limpopo Corridor (LC). Using Landsat satellite imagery, we mapped a variety of ecosystems with high classification accuracy, and integrated this map with field-based data and InVEST models to assess ecosystem services. We identified and mapped 27 ecosystems in the corridor, with an overall accuracy of 95.8 %. The findings highlight the greater potential of the LC to provide vital livelihood diversification services supporting local communities' adaptation to climatic change. Specifically, the southern part of the corridor exhibited high potential for services such as medicinal plants, food, aesthetic value, erosion control, crop pollination, spiritual well-being, ecotherapy, and nutrient retention. In contrast, the northern part of the corridor showed the highest potential for habitat quality and recreational services. This study provides an important baseline for devising sustainable ecosystem management strategies and climate change adaptation plans in dryland regions under increasing socio-economic pressures.

AB  - The approach of defining landscape patterns based on climate indices is applied in a case study area in North-Central Bulgaria. The results proved the strong interrelation between the climate indices and the elevation, enabling the implementation of a regression model. The results of the regression are used to define threshold values for delineation of all potential contours based on climate indices. The GIS modelling enables the integration of the results from different indices for the delineation of landscape contours of five potential landscape types. Four of them are validated with higher precision, proving the approach's applicability. One of the main capacities of the proposed approach is the opportunity for reconstructing climax vegetation and furthermore, the climax ecosystems that form the matrix of the potential landscapes. This can significantly contribute to assessing ecosystems and their services for restoration measures and implementing nature-based solutions.

AB  - The boundary between the humid eastern and the arid western regions of the Great Plains of North America is of great economic interest and historic intrigue, yet its location is controversial. Areas to the east of this boundary have historically enjoyed the benefits of fertile soil coupled with more favorable rainfall and reliable surface water, permitting conventional agriculture to flourish over a remarkably large percentage of the eastern Great Plains. The expansion of population and agriculture during the nineteenth century across the western Great Plains tested the extent that non-irrigated, row crop agriculture could be successful in areas where year-to-year rainfall was unreliable. In this paper, we quantify the historic annual variability of soil moisture and hydrologic conditioning in the Great Plains resulting from climatic variability, show the regions that historically demonstrate unreliable precipitation, and identify the extent of arid regions of the central United States based on modeled annual soil moisture variability. We asked how arid climates have influenced soil formation patterns at small cartographic scales, and how soil properties buffer or enhance soil moisture regimes (at the udic–ustic boundary) to climate variability at larger cartographic scales. At small cartographic scales, a climate-only model worked nearly as well as a climate-and-soils model in mapping the region's soil moisture boundary; however, a climate-only model missed important local soil influences. Finally, we demonstrate that long-term climate and climate variability are reflected in the depth and concentration of the calcic soil properties. From a practical standpoint, our work highlights that soils with higher water holding capacity dampen periodic short-term rainfall deficits, while soils with lower water holding capacity can exhibit edaphic drought during otherwise normal climate years.

AB  - The length of global coastline is about 356 thousand kilometers with various dynamic natural and anthropogenic. Although the number of studies on coastal landscape categorization has been increasing, it is still difficult to distinguish precisely them because the used methods commonly are traditional qualitative ones. With the leverage of remote sensing data and GIS tools, it helps categorize and identify a variety of features on land and water based on multi-source data. The aim of study is using different natural – social profile data obtained from ALOS, NOAA, and multi-temporal Landsat satellite images as input data of the convolutional-neural-network (CvNet) models for coastal landscape classification. Studies used 900 cut-line samples which represent coastal landscapes in Vietnam for training and optimizing CvNet models. As a result, nine coastal landscapes were identified including: deltas, alluvial, mature and young sand dunes, cliff, lagoon, tectonic, karst, and transitional landscapes. Three CvNet models using three different optimizer types classified the landscapes of other 1150 cut-lines in Vietnam with the accuracies about 98% and low loss function value. Excepting dalmatian, karst and delta coastal landscapes, five others distribute heterogeneous along the coasts in Vietnam. Therefore, the evaluation of additional natural components is necessary and CvNet model have ability to update new landscape types in variety of tropical nation as a step toward coastal landscape classification at both national and global scales.

AB  - Worldwide, peatlands suffer from land subsidence and greenhouse gas emissions due to artificial drainage inducing peat decomposition. Under anthropogenic climate change, these issues require measures to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and protect low-lying areas from increasing flood risk. Tighter control of groundwater levels is required, both within existing agricultural systems and through the development of new agricultural systems suitable for farming under high groundwater levels or inundation. The complexity and value-laden nature of the issue warrants the development of a comprehensive overview of potential and side effects of measures. In this paper such an overview is synthesized based on a mixed-method approach for a special case, The Netherlands. The Dutch peatlands comprise extensive land areas in the low-lying west and north of The Netherlands. The case is exceptional as most of these peatlands lie below sea level, sustain world-class intensive dairy farming and are subject to multiple other environmental, economic and societal challenges. Here, land subsidence increases flood risk, salt-water intrusion and the costs of water management, particularly under global climate change. To mitigate land subsidence, both technical measures and alternative land uses can be envisaged. However, the literature about these is fragmented, complicating a careful identification and selection of measures. To address this knowledge gap, we review 27 technical measures and alternative land use options and synthesize evidence and insights for 15 effects. Technical measures allowing continuation of existing dairy farming provide relatively low-risk interventions for farmers, but will only reduce, not stop land subsidence and greenhouse gas emissions. Alternative land-use options, particularly paludiculture, are in a start-up stage of development and can stop land subsidence. However, more research is required to reduce and control methane and potential nitrous oxide emissions during inundation required for crops such as (narrowleaf) cattail and azolla. Paludiculture can provide ecosystem services related to water management and nutrient status, as well as raw materials for a bio-based economy. Gradual transitions in space and time between farming and nature can be envisaged, providing incentives to diversify land use in the Dutch peatlands. This case study identifies key questions and provides valuable insights for peatland management worldwide. Reducing land subsidence and greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands is feasible, but requires thoughtful interventions that cautiously make and align trade-offs between various interests and uncertainties.

AB  - Geomorphology is fundamental to landscape analysis, as it represents the main parameter that determines the land spatial configuration and facilitates reliefs classification. The goal of this article is the elaboration of thematic maps that enable the determination of different landscape units and elaboration of quality and vulnerability synthetic maps for landscape fragility assessment prior to planning human activities. For two natural spaces, the final synthetic maps were created with direct (visual-perceptual features) and indirect (cartographic models and 3D simulations) methods from thematic maps with GIS technique. This enabled the creation of intrinsic and extrinsic landscape quality maps showing sectors needing most preservation, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic landscape fragility maps (environment response capacity or vulnerability towards human actions). The resulting map shows absorption capacity for areas of maximum and/or minimum human intervention. Sectors of high absorption capacity (minimum need for preservation) are found where the incidence of human intervention is minimum: escarpment bottoms, fitted rivers, sinuous high lands with thick vegetation coverage and valley interiors, or those areas with high landscape quality, low fragility and high absorption capacity, whose average values are found across lower hillsides of some valleys, and sectors with low absorption capacity (areas needing most preservation) found mainly in the inner parts of natural spaces: peaks and upper hillsides, synclines flanks and scattered areas. For the integral analysis of landscape, a mapping methodology has been set. It comprises a valid criterion for rational and sustainable planning, management and protection of natural spaces.

AB  - Although there have been numerous studies on the heritage attributes, characteristics, and values of the historic garden as a special category of cultural heritage, the question is why a comprehensive review combining mainstream historic garden conservation with ways of understanding the garden in a landscape context has not been conducted. Landscape is an integrative concept that combines physical features and the diversity of functions with social and ecological processes throughout the scales of time and space. Therefore, this landscape context means applying the landscape approach to explore the organic connection between the scale of evolution and the architectonic elements in relation to each other. To elaborate, instead of viewing the garden as an object in one specific temporal-spatial frame, such an approach focuses on the evolution of the site in order to identify persistent structures and other values. The method used in this study involved paper coding as qualitative analysis combined with bibliometric visualization software. We reviewed 162 studies to explore the interconnections between the historic garden and landscape approach. The result is that there are three correspondences between landscape approaches and different stages of the historic garden’s conservation and development: studies identifying the historic garden’s characteristics using landscape mapping, studies demonstrating historic gardens’ conservation based on landscape planning, and studies exploring the potential of development and reuse through landscape design. Finally, we discuss the research gaps and outline an action framework for the conservation and development of heritage gardens in a landscape context.

AB  - Society is increasingly in need of renewable resources to replace fossil fuels and to prevent resource depletion. River-floodplain systems are known to provide important societal functions and ecosystem services to mankind, such as production of vegetative biomass. In order to determine the potential of harvesting vegetative riparian biomass, the capacity of river systems to produce such biomass needs to be determined. We developed a method for quantifying the spatiotemporal development of annual biomass production in river floodplains. Vegetation specific growth rates were linked to a landscape classification system (i.e., the Ecotope System for National Waterways). Biomass production was calculated for floodplains along the three Rhine River distributaries (i.e., the rivers Waal, Nederrijn-Lek and IJssel) over a 15year period (1997–2012). During this period several large scale river management measures were undertaken to reduce flood risks and improve the spatial quality of the Rhine River as part of the Room for the River program. Biomass production decreased by 12%–16% from 1997 to 2012 along the three distributaries, which may be a side effect of flood mitigation. Almost 90% of the biomass produced was non-woody (e.g., grass/hay, reed, crops), which decreased along all three river distributaries due to the abandonment of production grasslands and the physical reconstruction of floodplains (e.g., creation of side channels). Woody vegetation, however, showed a slight increase during the 15year period likely owing to vegetation succession from shrubs to softwood forest.

AB  - Local Climate Zones (LCZ) classification is an essential tool in addressing the environmental impacts of urbanization, particularly in mitigating Urban Heat Islands (UHI) and managing temperature variations. A systematic review was conducted using PSALSAR methodology, analyzing 126 publications from Scopus and Web of Science databases from 2018 to 2023. Recent advances in LCZ research were evaluated, with a focus on the increasing use of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for landscape classification. The findings indicate that key urban geometry parameters, such as the Sky View Factor (SVF) and Height of Roughness Elements (HRE), are crucial for analyzing solar radiation and temperature control. The review highlights that 17.64 % of the studies are concentrated in high-income countries, underscoring the need for more representation from Latin American cities and other emerging economies. Despite data limitations, 15.68 % of the studies analyzed imperviousness and permeability. Research gaps in underrepresented regions emphasize the necessity of incorporating additional parameters such as Proportion of Woodland and Grass (PWG), Fraction of Vegetation Coverage (FVC), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Built-up Area (BA), Floor Area Ratio (FAR), and Normalized Difference Building Index (NDBI) to enhance the LCZ classification framework. This research emphasizes the significant role of remote sensing and GIS in improving accuracy in local scale UHI studies. Integrating LCZ mapping into urban planning is essential for managing landscape heterogeneity and fostering sustainable development. Expanding access to open urban datasets and adopting innovative digital methods will further advance LCZ research globally.

AB  - Coastal flooding affects physical and social place attachments. Values-based approaches to climate change adaptation examine how risks to place attachments are distributed within and among communities, with a view to informing equitable adaptation policies. In this nascent body of research, divergent theoretical frameworks and empirical approaches to measuring social values are evolving. While some studies explore the things people value about their everyday lives generally—the lived values approach, others locate specific social and cultural values in geographic space—the landscape values mapping approach. This study aims to compare the explanatory value of these two approaches for understanding the social risks of sea-level rise, and appraise whether either or both approaches are likely to meet local adaptation planning needs. It does this by examining the potential social impacts of sea-level rise in Kingston Beach, Australia, informed by a mail-out survey of the community. The lived values approach identified that the natural environment, scenery, relaxed lifestyle and safety are highly important to local residents, while the landscape values mapping approach revealed that Kingston Main Beach is the most highly valued of eight coastal landscape units. Incorporating the landscape values mapping into the lived values cluster analysis revealed that while Kingston Main Beach is highly important for its recreational value to some members of the community, for others manmade features such as community halls or sports ovals may be of higher importance because they facilitate social interactions. There is potential to further integrate these two approaches to better inform adaptation policy about how lived and landscape values are distributed among communities, where they are located in space and whether they change over time. A deeper understanding of such assigned values can lead to improved engagement with coastal residents to inform adaptation policy now and into the future.

AB  - Global change and habitat fragmentation are critical issues in our society. While considerable progress has been made in these issues worldwide, the unique features of the agroecosystems in the Great Plains have not been given enough attention. In this region, croplands occupy the majority of the landscape, forming the mosaics with linear riparian zones and shelterbelts. These three elements play different roles in the maintenance of biodiversity, and their continued effectiveness under a changing climate is critical to maintaining a healthy and productive agricultural ecosystem. This article evaluates current research and discusses future directions. The goal is to provide a scientific base for future conservation biology and wildlife management.

AB  - Balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) is projected to decline in the Acadian Forest Region under climate change. We hypothesized that along a 700 km latitudinal gradient with increasing mean annual temperature from New Brunswick to Nova Scotia, Canada, balsam fir regeneration density and growth rates would (1) decline with warming and (2) decline more in immature than in mature stands due to greater exposure to adverse climate conditions. Regeneration density, height growth, and lateral branch growth were measured in 30 mature and 28 immature plots and related to climate and stand variables using generalized additive models. Balsam fir regeneration density was negatively affected by increased mean annual temperature and increased with summer precipitation, supporting our first hypothesis, but varied by height class. Canopy cover significantly affected seedling density, but its effect varied by substrate type (coniferous litter and dry moss litter), with seedling density being greatest under low canopy cover for large seedlings and greatest at intermediate canopy cover for small seedlings. Seedling growth rates were determined by height class, canopy cover, precipitation, and coniferous litter cover. Stand maturity did not significantly affect fir regeneration density or growth rates. Our results indicate that over time, increasing mean annual temperature may reduce balsam fir regeneration density within the Acadian Forest Region, while the marginal summer precipitation increases may lead to small gains in growth.

AB  - This chapter provides an introduction to agent-based modeling [Wiki] and computer vision techniques in Python, diving into the technical details of a specific class of problems. I show how to use generative models based on synthetic data, to simulate terrain evolution or other natural phenomena such as cloud formation or climate change. The material is accessible and targeted to software engineers interested in understanding and applying the machine learning and probabilistic background behind the scene, as well as to machine learning professionals interested in the programming aspects and scientific computing. The end-goal is to help the reader design and implement his own models and generate his own data sets, by showcasing an interesting application with all the details. My Python code can also be used as an end in itself. This type of application is referred to as generative AI. From a machine learning perspective, the stochastic processes involved can be compared to spatial time series or time-continuous chaotic dynamical systems. There is a similarity with constrained Brownian motions, where at each time, rather than observing a typical observation (say a vector of stock prices), the observation consists of a particular configuration of the entire space (for instance, a moving storm system at a given time). In this chapter, the focus is on stationary-like processes. I briefly discuss the probabilistic models behind my algorithms, to explain when they work, and when they do not. However, I limit theoretical discussions to the essential, so that software engineers and other professionals lacking a strong mathematical background, can easily read and benefit from my presentation. A possible use of my methodology is to automatically generate and label a large number of different landscapes (mountains, sea, land, combinations, and so on) to create a large training set. The training set can be used as augmented data for landscape classification, or to generate more landscape within a specific category to further enrich the classifier. The methodology can also be used to simulate transitions and reconstruct the hidden statistical behavior over short periods of time, when granular observations are not available. Finally, in addition to modeling and simulating uncontrolled evolutionary processes, the animated data visualizations also feature image morphing, both in the state space (coalescing physical shapes) and the spectral space (palette and color morphing).

AB  - The challenges posed by climate change and biodiversity loss are deeply interconnected. Successful co-managing of these tangled drivers requires innovative methods that can prioritize and target management actions against multiple criteria, while also enabling cost-effective land use planning and impact scenario assessment. This paper synthesises the development and application of an integrated multidisciplinary modelling and evaluation framework for carbon and biodiversity in forest systems. By analysing and spatio-temporally modelling carbon processes and biodiversity elements, we determine an optimal solution for their co-management in the study landscape. We also describe how advanced Earth Observation measurements can be used to enhance mapping and monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. The scenarios used for the dynamic models were based on official Finnish policy goals for forest management and climate change mitigation. The development and testing of the system were executed in a large region in southern Finland (Kokemäenjoki basin, 27,024 km2) containing highly instrumented LTER (Long-Term Ecosystem Research) stations; these LTER data sources were complemented by fieldwork, remote sensing and national data bases. In the study area, estimated total net emissions were currently 4.2 TgCO2eq a−1, but modelling of forestry measures and anthropogenic emission reductions demonstrated that it would be possible to achieve the stated policy goal of carbon neutrality by low forest harvest intensity. We show how this policy-relevant information can be further utilized for optimal allocation of set-aside forest areas for nature conservation, which would significantly contribute to preserving both biodiversity and carbon values in the region. Biodiversity gain in the area could be increased without a loss of carbon-related benefits.

AB  - Landscape is an area formed by human and nature interactions. These areas may have some differences. These differences are expressed by the character of the area. Landscape character can be defined as the presence, diversity and arrangement of landscape features that give a certain identity to landscape and make it stand out from the surrounding landscapes. Recently, Landscape Character Analysis (LCA) studies have gained momentum in order to gather more information about the landscape and to make sustainable plans and fulfill the obligations arising from the European Landscape Agreement. In this study, the Aras Basin located in the province of Erzurum in eastern Turkey are discussed using the LCA and optimum land use methodology. Natural and cultural data of the study area were digitized and analyzed with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). According to the analysis results, 14 different landscape character areas and 384 landscape character types obtained in the Aras Basin. Also, optimum land uses of the study area were determined and incompatibility was examined between these areas and landscape character types. Based on the results, the study is considered to be a data source for future implementation, management and development policies related to the basin.

AB  - Opencast mining activities destroy native vegetation, directly impacting the carbon sequestration capacity of the regional ecosystem. Restoring tree species have significant impacts on carbon storage. However, changes in carbon storage across tree-level landscape and the impact of tree-level landscape transitions on carbon storage remain poorly described in the literature, and this information is urgently needed to support management decisions. In this study, we combined field data and remote sensing techniques to create field data-driven maps of the tree-level landscape. This enabled the assessment of carbon storage and quantification of the impact of tree-level landscape transitions on carbon storage. We founded that carbon storage rises in initial/stable stages, decreases in development stage during mining expansion and reclamation. The choice of restoration tree species significantly influenced carbon storage. Pinus tabuliformis-R. pseudoacacia accumulated more carbon storage, making it a more suitable model for ecological reclamation of Pingshuo opencast mine. Furthermore, changes in carbon storage are influenced by land-use policies. Land-use policies and reclamation efforts counterbalance carbon loss associated with construction. Various tree-level landscape transitions were examined, with Pinus tabuliformis transitions notably affecting carbon storage, offering insights for ecological reclamation planning. Our research provides a reference for carbon storage assessment in opencast mining areas, enhances understanding of carbon storage changes in mining areas, assists in formulating ecological reclamation plans, and contributes to the “dual‑carbon” goals and climate change mitigation.

AB  - Global climate change is gradually altering species distribution and spatial patterns of diversity. Yet, climatic factors influencing the local distribution and habitat preferences for southern African species remain largely unexplored. As such, predicting species distribution patterns and identifying environmental covariates that promote species range expansion will be critical in developing management protocols for biodiversity protection. Maxent, a species distribution model algorithm that applies a maximum entropy machine learning technique, is used in this study to map the geographical distributions of appropriate habitats for Colophospermum mopane (J.Kirk ex Benth.) J. Léonard in southern Africa under current and future climate change scenarios. We identified the highest contributors to the modelled distributions and calculated the range changes (expansion or loss) in southern Africa for C. mopane under three Representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for the 2050s and 2070s. Our results showed that the distribution of C. mopane was mainly influenced by solar radiation, annual temperature range, and annual precipitation. We also observe that C. mopane is distributed continuously in southern Africa, from southern Angola and northern Namibia to central-southern Mozambique, with a total occurrence area of 1,281,242 km2. According to the species response curves, this species preferred habitats with annual precipitation of 130–200 mm, an annual temperature range of 22–28 °C, and elevations of about 500–1000 m above sea level. Under climate change scenarios, suitable habitat areas reduced significantly in the northern limits of the potential distribution areas while they expanded in the southern limits. Overall, the appropriate habitat areas will likely expand the least (4.08–4.46%) and decline the most (8.83–10.08%) under the extreme scenario of RCP8.5, depending on the year. Although there is a lack of consensus on the range changes in future distributions among the various RCPs, it is clear that solar radiation will significantly limit the distribution of C. mopane. This knowledge is important for landscape planners and rangeland managers working to safeguard biodiversity from extinction.

AB  - In China, 55 ethnic minority groups, accounting for 8.49% of the total population, live on 64.2% of the total land area. In the context of globalization and modernization, these areas retain a wealth of natural and cultural landscape types. Few studies have been conducted on landscape character on a regional scale in China, and to the best of our knowledge, none in multi-ethnic areas. Our study site was Wuling Mountain, which is located in southwest China and populated by multi-ethnic communities. Nine minorities including the Dong, Gelao, Miao, and Tujia have lived in the area for generations, coexisting with Han Chinese. We analyzed trans-regional data to visualize and identify the landscape character types of Wuling Mountain at two levels. The types were characterized at a resolution of 1km2 based on elevation, relief amplitude, land cover, and ethnic population density. The latter, as a special cultural variable of a multi-ethnic area, indirectly reflects the regional differences in the lives and livelihood activities of different ethnic groups. We used the affinity propagation (AP) algorithm based on a bottom-up approach of a combination of the geographic information system (GIS). The results highlighted the inhabited landscape characteristics of different combinations of minority ethnic populations and the key landscape characteristics that could be used as a basis for the development of trans-regional protection, management, and planning of the natural and cultural landscape in this multi-ethnic area.

AB  - There is disagreement about the potential for regenerative management practices to sequester sufficient soil organic carbon (SOC) to help mitigate climate change. Measuring change in SOC stocks following practice adoption at the grain of farm fields, within the extent of regional agriculture, could help resolve this disagreement. Yet sampling demands to quantify change are considered infeasible primarily because within-field variation in stock sizes is thought to obscure accurate quantification of management effects on incremental SOC accrual. We evaluate this ‘infeasibility assumption’ using high-density (e.g., 0.1 ha sample–1), within-field, sampling data from 45 cropland fields inventoried for SOC. We explore how more typical within-field sampling densities, as well as field numbers and magnitude of simulated change in SOC stocks, impacts the ability to accurately quantify management effects on SOC change. We find that (1) stock change estimates for individual fields are inaccurate and variable, where marked losses and gains in SOC stocks are frequently estimated even when no change has occurred. Higher sampling densities (e.g., 1.2 versus 4.0 ha sample–1) narrow the range of estimated stock changes but inaccuracies remain large. (2) The accuracy of stock change estimates at the project level (i.e., multiple fields) were similarly sensitive to sampling density. In contrast to individual fields, however, higher sampling densities, as well as a greater number of fields (e.g., 30), generated robust and accurate, mean project-level estimates of carbon accrual, with ∼ 80 % of the estimates falling within 20 % of the simulated stock change. Yet such monitoring designs do not account for dynamic baselines, which necessitates measurement of stock changes in control, non-regenerative fields. We find (3) that higher sampling densities (e.g., 1.2 versus 4.0 ha sample–1), field numbers (e.g., 30 versus 10 pairs of fields), and magnitudes of simulated SOC stock change (+3 and +5 versus +1 Mg C ha−1 10 y–1) are then collectively required to make accurate estimates of management effects on stock change at the project level. The simulated effect sizes that could be consistently detected under these conditions included rates of SOC accrual considered achievable and meaningful for climate mitigation (e.g., 3 Mg C ha−1 10 y–1), with field numbers and sampling densities that are reasonable given current sampling methods. Our findings reveal the potential to use empirical approaches to accurately quantify, at project scales, SOC stock responses to practice change. We provide recommendations for data that government, farmer and corporate entities should measure and share to build confidence in the effects of regenerative practices, freeing the SOC debate from overreliance on theory and data collected at scales mismatched with agricultural management.

AB  - Coastal salt marsh wetlands constitute one of the three blue carbon ecosystems, playing a pivotal ecological role in carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas mitigation. The spatio-temporal monitoring of coastal salt marsh facilitates the assessment of their resilience to climate change and aids decision-makers in formulating effective wetland policies. The Google Earth Engine (GEE), a remote sensing cloud platform, offers a new perspective for such endeavors. This study, leveraging GEE, integrates climatic features and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) for the precise extraction of salt marsh vegetation, enabling remote sensing monitoring of spatial and temporal dynamics of over an extended time series. Using random forest classification, three types of typical coastal salt marsh vegetation in Yancheng City were accurately extracted. The refined extraction method demonstrated superior efficiency and convenience in subdividing and monitoring coastal salt marsh vegetation compared with traditional methods, with high accuracy. In addition, the study observed distinct change characteristics in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Iindex (NDVI) values of three typical salt marsh vegetation types in Yancheng, China, from 2000 to 2020. Specifically, Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora showed an expansion trend, while the area of Suaeda salsa contracted. Precipitation exhibited a more pronounced impact on salt marsh vegetation growth compared to temperature. Consequently, this study holds significant implications for the precise extraction of salt marsh vegetation and long-time monitoring, playing a crucial role in wetland ecological protection and sustainable development.

AB  - The Three Rivers Headwaters Region is one of the most import ecological protection regions and Tibetan inhabited regions in China. Located in the Qinghai province of China, the Region is the source of the Yangtze, the Yellow and the Lantsang-Mekong Rivers. This study region was based on remote sensing imagery. An ecological landscape classification of the area is presented, as well as a suite of landscape indices for landscape pattern changes from 1987 to 2015. The influence of human activities on the landscape change of study area is discussed. The results showed landscape structure complexity, fragmentation gradually increased, while the indices of contagion and evenness were decreased. Structure characteristic of landscape change in this region are more obvious, especially, the difference in space distributions of part and the whole. There were trend of uniform distribution of different types and diversity gradually increased in the source of Yangtze River. And an opposite tendency is showing in the Yellow River and Lantsang-Mekong River. Physical-geographical conditions, climate change and government policy at study period were the main reasons of significant landscape pattern change. This study proposes management measures for sustainable development in the Three Rivers Headwaters Region.

AB  - Climate and weather-related damage have been increasing globally in recent decades. Due to climate change and socio-economic developments, a further increase in climate-related risks is expected. Numerous countries have a long and successful history in disaster risk management (DRM) to avoid, minimize and manage damage caused by extreme weather events. In addition, climate change adaptation (CCA) focuses on managing the risks resulting from climate change today and in the future. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of managing climate-related risks, these two independent approaches need to be linked closer in a more holistic approach – a concept that has been termed climate risk management (CRM). In order to build stronger ties in practice, it is crucial to first understand current governance structures in specific countries or regions. This paper focuses on Austria, a country with experience in both DRM and CCA. In this paper, we present a comprehensive picture of the stakeholder landscape and governance structures in the context of managing climate-related risks. We focus on flooding and agricultural drought, two key risks in Austria. Building on a literature review and a two-stage stakeholder process, consisting of stakeholder interviews and stakeholder workshops, relevant institutions and actors were identified and assigned to a 4-phase CRM cycle. Moreover, specific activities of the identified actors and interactions between them were determined. Based on these insights, we conclude that a comprehensive CRM, which aligns DRM and CCA practice, does not yet exist in Austria. We propose to establish the missing CRM decision-making structures by e.g. instituting a legally-anchored national climate risk council, which can act as an interface between CRM practice and political decision-making.

AB  - Landscape patterns originate from exogenous (e.g., climate) and endogenous (e.g., competition) processes and feedbacks that interact spatially and temporally. The resulting dynamics can be analyzed and quantified using spatio-temporal models. Various approaches are currently in use, ranging from generic to process-oriented models. However, strict classifications are difficult as models can be characterized by many different criteria. One important distinction is structural complexity. This may manifest itself in: (1) conceptual complication of the modelling approach, (2) the translation of the system complexity into model formalism, and (3) the level of detail of the simulated output. Thus, process models that mirror systems by quantifying individual biotic and/or abiotic processes may be referred to as complex models since their simulated output usually identifies explicit system details that require many input parameters mirroring the system bottom-up. Generic models, on the other hand, tend to be structurally parsimonious, usually not accounting for specific system details. They are often applied to study topics of complex systems theory such as emergence, self-organization, scaling, and chaos theory, and involving techniques used in non-linear dynamical systems theory. This special issue identifies concepts and methods used by models to represent spatially dynamic landscape patterns. It assesses relationships between landscape and model complexity, and discusses approaches to quantify the spatio-temporal pattern dynamics resulting from model simulations. The models presented here address a variety of different research topics, including climate change, urban development, ecological engineering, landscape classification concepts, spatial population dynamics, habitat fragmentation, and conservation. The models account for different biotic levels (individual, population, vegetation patterns), and are driven by both exogenous and endogenous processes. Identification and quantification of the landscape patterns produced by the simulated output relies on various indicators. Discrete-static indicators include landscape metrics. Static pattern descriptions involve fractal dimensions, whereas dynamic indicators include power spectra, entropy, or indicators of patch aggregation. Thematically, this special issue contributes to a variety of key topics in landscape ecology, including consideration of anthropogenic impacts on landscapes, or holistic approaches such as self-organization, or the governing role of connectivity in shaping ecological systems.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to describe the development and implementation of an integrated framework for landscape sensitivity assessment in Cyprus, a biodiversity hotspot with high landscape diversity. Akamas peninsula, the western tip of the island covering an area of 230 km2, is under great pressure for development, notwithstanding it hosts 21 terrestrial habitats, four of which are priority at European level, in addition to 48 endangered plant species. Following previous coarse scale landscape mapping on the island, a more detailed landscape map at 1:10,000 scale (Level III) was produced, appropriate for local planning purposes. Overall landscape sensitivity was evaluated as a function of ecological, cultural and visual sensitivity of the study area. 66 Land Description Units (LDUs) were mapped and 38 Landscape Types (LCTs) were identified for the Akamas peninsula. Ecological sensitivity assessment for Akamas determined that 85 % of the LDUs have high to very high sensitivity with those within Natura 2000 sites having the highest. Out of 66 LDUs, 35 % were of high or moderate cultural sensitivity and there were 32 LDUs with high overall landscape sensitivity i.e. when visual sensitivity was also considered. Based on the various degrees of sensitivity identified in this study, the task of policy makers is to establish a policy response for each landscape type based on the principles and practice of sustainability. In the Mediterranean, the development of an integrated assessment for landscape sensitivity is critically important at a time of rapid change.

AB  - Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) has become a priority for many states wanting to develop national blue economy plans and meet international obligations in response to the increasing cumulative impacts of human activities and climate change. In areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), MSP is proposed as part of a package of solutions for multi-sectoral management at the ocean basin scale. To facilitate planning, maps showing the spatial distribution of marine biological diversity are required. In areas lacking data, like the South Atlantic, environmental proxies can be used to predict these distributions. We undertook broad-scale benthic habitat classification of the South Atlantic, employing two top-down approaches spanning from national waters to ABNJ. The first was non-hierarchical and clustered groups of environmental variables prior to combination; the second was hierarchical and clustered Principal Components of environmental variables. Areas of agreement between the two approaches were identified and results compared with existing national and global classifications and published biodiversity patterns. We highlight several habitat classes we can be cautiously confident represent variation in biological diversity, such as topographic features, frontal systems and some abyssal basins. We also identify critical gaps in our knowledge of regional biogeography and advocate for collaborative effort to compile benthic species records and promote further exploration of the region to address these gaps. These insights into the distribution of habitats have the potential to support sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction, enable transboundary and ocean basin scale management, and empower nations to make progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Urban Green Spaces (UGSs) play a vital role in mitigating various urban challenges, particularly climate change and achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, rapid urbanisation led to sharp decline in UGS share due to competing infrastructural demands. Presently, urban greening initiatives are primarily focussing on UGS monitoring, especially in highly-dense urban areas. Remote sensing (RS) technologies have emerged as valuable means for data collection and analysis, reducing the need for time-intensive field surveys. Yet, there is a lack of comprehensive review of RS approaches and sensors commonly used in UGS evaluation. This paper addresses this gap by reviewing RS-based UGS studies (2013−2023) using PRISMA technique. Five broad domains of RS application were identified: climate change, landscape pattern, human health and well-being, vegetation functionality, and rapid urbanisation using bibliometric cluster-analysis. Additionally, thematic analysis of bibliographic metadata revealed five key themes predominantly linked to SDGs 11, 13 and 15: spatio-temporal evaluation (29 %), urbanisation impacts (13 %), urban vegetation monitoring (18 %), environmental monitoring (17 %) and urban ecosystem service assessment (23 %). Each theme includes specific RS parameters and metrics creating an inventory of RS-based UGS evaluation methods. Additionally, the study developed a comparative review framework addressing the RS approaches adopted in developed and developing countries.

AB  - The grass family is responsible for most of peoples pollen allergies, and the severity of pollen-based asthma and allergies is expected to increase with global climate change. Identifying grass species through standard pollen monitoring techniques have limitations due to challenges in species-specific pollen identification. As a result, these monitoring methods end up grouping all Poaceae species together, even though there are hundreds of grass species in Europe with flowering times that may vary drastically among species. Given this lack of specificity, it is hard to know which grass species are responsible for causing allergies over the pollen season, and how different species are affected by climate change. To address these issues, we obtained phenological data from thousands of herbarium specimens collected across Denmark spanning 190 years and used pollen monitoring data collected over the last four decades to determine the response of flowering time to climate change for 12 allergenic grass species, and identify which species are likely the biggest contributors to grass pollen loads throughout the pollen season. We find that pollen season duration is lasting longer and starting earlier, and the maximum pollen loads are occurring earlier in response to climate warming. Herbarium specimens provide taxonomic resolution and reveal that many grass species are flowering earlier in response to warmer spring temperatures. Seven out of the 12 species studied in Denmark are identified as major contributors to airborne pollen based on their flowering times, relative abundance and overlap with the time of the year when maximum pollen loads are detected. Four species (Poa pratensis, Dactylis glomerata, Festuca rubra, Holcus lanatus) significantly shifted their flowering time in response to warming temperatures and are flagged as of particular concern to allergy sufferers. Using data derived from natural history collections can contribute to the advancement of pollen forecasting for asthma and allergy patients under both current conditions and amidst future global changes.

AB  - The Pantanal is an important active sedimentary basin in central South America where highly diverse flora and fauna are sustained by seasonal floods. Intense land use in the catchment areas enhanced sediment load and destabilized avulsive river systems in the plains. A well-known avulsion in the Taquari River during the 1980–90s, called “Zé da Costa”, has shifted the river mouth and drastically changed the nearby landscapes, making them difficult to map because of the hard access and the large variations in spectral and spatial attributes of raster data like Landsat images. Therefore, we developed a useful method to map and explore landscape changes in “Zé da Costa” avulsion that combines geotagged field pictures, randomly selected high-resolution orbital truths, normalized difference vegetation index, digital elevation models, linear spectral mixture models and Landsat historical imagery in pixel-based and object-oriented supervised classifications. We found that bands in green, red, and near-infrared spectra provide better mapping results with object-oriented algorithms for deriving and studying temporal dry/wet ratio dynamics. The temporal analyses of the dry/wet ratio showed that avulsions in the Taquari River have the potential to change permanently the “Zé da Costa” area into a dry landscape, making it susceptible for land use (deforestation and fire), except areas seasonally inundated by the floods of the Paraguay River. Overall, our method might be also useful for long-term studies of land use and climate change in avulsive rivers in wetlands around the world.

AB  - In the strategic expansion of protected areas, it is imperative to address sustainable development challenges by exploring innovative approaches to harmonize the conservation and utilization of ecological resources and landscape. Particularly, geological landscape category of national parks （GLNPs）in developing countries possess not only aesthetic value but also serve as productive resources that foster community prosperity. Adhering to the fundamental principles of protecting the authenticity and integrity of the landscape ecological system, this study proposes a novel methodology for delineating the national park (NP) boundary to balance the relationship between the landscape ecological resources protection and community development under the technical framework. We have delineated three national park schemes in Zanda Tulin, covering areas of 4597.04 km², 8109.28 km², and 4594.08 km², respectively. We propose the concept of a "synergistic zone" and argue that，considering the effective supply of agricultural production space and the uncertain impacts of future climate change on landscape resources, the 'one park, two zones, and three lines' model can effectively address these challenges.

AB  - Availability of digital elevation models (DEM) of increased spatial resolution has triggered interest in texture-based methods for automated geomorphometry. This prospect is all the more appealing concerning tropical countries for which mapping of geomorphic entities has remained limited despite its relevance for natural resource assessment and land planning. In this paper we applied to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM a multiscale texture analysis based on Fourier 2D periodogram (FOTO method) to reach a spatially coherent mapping that would agree with current knowledge over the conterminous territories of French Guiana and Amapa (Brazil). Through a principal component analysis, FOTO-extracted textural features were found complementary and combined with six common physiographic criteria (convexity, wetness index, dissection, elevation, and percent of steep and low slopes) calculated from the DEM. This provided a primary semiautomated mapping of 16 classes of landform types. To increase legibility, we aggregated into eight landscape unit classes that were the most similar in terms of texture and relief criteria while being frequently contiguous. The resulting map was compared with existing maps that were, however, more local or of lesser resolution and informative content over the region of interest. Multiscale Fourier spectra proved useful to depict land surface texture and, in synergy with relief variables, allowed identifying a large variety of landforms for broad-scale geomorphic mapping in the humid tropics.

AB  - Modelling urban floods is essential for disaster prevention, yet it faces limitations in accuracy due to technical, operational, and functional constraints. The study employs a primary market research analysis to explore the perspectives of both academic and non-academic experts in urban flood modelling (UFM). Identified issues include inadequate spatial and temporal model resolution, high data requirements, and non-intuitive user interfaces. Opportunities are recognized in integrating flood risks, social dynamics, future land use, climate data, and real-time information while reducing computational costs and improving usability. To address these aspects, a holistic framework has been proposed that includes features like hybrid-physics AI modelling, real-time data integration, compound flood simulation, transfer learning, sociohydrology tools, future scenario forecasting, cloud-based pipelines, interoperability, compatibility, and AI-enhanced parallel computing and user interface. Finally, we presented an ecosystem map illustrating stakeholder roles in UFM. The findings offer valuable insights into refining UFM for enhanced urban flood resilience.

AB  - The Brahmaputra River basin exhibits a variety of landforms, including alluvial fans, old and active floodplains, and piedmont belts. The surface expression of the subsurface basement ridge, known as the Brahmaputra Arc, is characterized by paleosol exposures aligned along its crestal region. Using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) chronology and paleopedological studies, four stages of landform development have been identified in this region, influenced by neotectonics and climate change. The soils in the study area have been categorized into four members of the Quaternary Brahmaputra Morphostratigraphic Sequence (QBMS). QBMS-I (<1.77 ka) represents the youngest soil found in the active floodplains, QBMS-II (2–3.65 ka) includes the Mikri hills piedmont and adjacent river plains, QBMS-III (4–6.5 ka) covers most parts of the study area and is formed on alluvium. The oldest unit QBMS-IV (>7 ka) is exposed on the crest of the Brahmaputra Arc. These soils provide insights into the geomorphologic history of the region, with QBMS-II and III recording multiple avulsions during the Holocene. Micromorphological studies indicate that these soils have undergone multi-phase development under varying redox conditions. The Mid-Miocene compression in the foreland basin led to the formation of the Brahmaputra Arch, and subsequent sedimentation covered the crestal part. Presently, erosion and removal of sediment from the crestal region have exposed older soils as paleosols. Two alluvial fans occur in the study area, the older one located in the central part and the younger one in the northeast corner. The Naga hill piedmonts also exhibit a similar distribution, with the older segment in the central part and younger segments in the northern and southern parts. These patterns of piedmonts and alluvial fans suggest distinct tectonic episodes responsible for sediment redistribution in the study area. The proximity of the Brahmaputra Arc and the Naga thrust in the central part further supports this observation. The findings of this study are consistent with the episodes of neotectonic activity in the nearby Ganga plain, highlighting their regional relevance. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the evolution of landforms in the Brahmaputra River basin, highlighting the role of neotectonics and climate change in shaping the landscape.

They shape the landscape in a characteristic way due to their erosive power, and the transportation and deposition of eroded material. GIS offers, in combination with remote sensing data and digital elevation models (DEMs), a powerful tool to identify glaciers and glacial landforms and analyze their characteristics and changes. This chapter presents basic concepts and established methods in this regard such as mapping of glaciers, identification of former glacier extents and glacial landforms in a GIS by using optical imagery and digital terrain analysis. Moreover, application of GIS and DEMs for investigating glacier area, volume, and mass changes are presented.

AB  - Human activities have shaped the coastal environment of the Mediterranean basin for millennia through agriculture, husbandry and the deliberate use of fire. With the decline of agriculture, in recent decades, other factors have caused a more severe impact on the coastal landscapes. These factors are the large scale developments for tourism, the process of urbanisation, the increase of summer visitor numbers, and the introduction of exotic plants. The most heavily affected habitats are the sandy coastal systems, and coastal dunes in particular. The area of Western Crete presents a perfect example of these degradation processes. Our study area comprises both natural coastal dune systems, as well as degraded beaches with high intensity human impact. The north facing coasts of the study area consist of several long stretching sandy beaches with well developed dune systems. However, in many cases these dunes are severely degraded due to uncontrolled building of tourist facilities right at the edge of the shore. To the west, it includes sites of natural dunes of outstanding beauty, which are designated for inclusion in the Natura 2000 network. We use both landscape and vegetation classification, to establish the relations between human impact and vegetation. Two different classifications, derived from these different data-sets are combined, in order to extract useful information on the value of landscape surveying on biodiversity estimation, and on the other hand, on the perspectives of using plant species as indicators of landscape change. Diverse land unit groups are identified, according to human impact processes and structural landscape variation. These classes of land units correlate with specific plant communities that are recognised from the phytosociological analysis. Indicator species are defined that can explain the level of intensity of human impact for a stretch of beach. These indicator species often do not match the frequently used character species.

AB  - Development of urban human settlement environments (HSEs) is an integral part of promoting high-quality and sustainable regional development and constructing a beautiful China. The city of Lanzhou, located at the geometric center of China, is the only provincial capital traversed by the Yellow River. Given the constraints posed by the valley topography and the need for economic development, the development of this HSE, which is located within an arid region, poses considerable challenges. Evidently, an understanding of the evolution of HSEs and drivers of changes in them contributes to high-quality, sustainable urban development in arid and semi-arid regions. An analytical model was developed using the parameters of relief degree of land surface, human comfort days, the land cover index, nighttime light index, and precipitation. This model was used in combination with population density and the gross domestic product to analyze the spatial distribution of Lanzhou's HSE and its drivers. The results showed that landscapes in Lanzhou underwent significant changes between 2000 and 2022, with an increase in building-up land (+0.946%), cultivated land (+0.134%), and forest land (+0.018%) and a decrease in grassland (−1.10%). There was significant outward expansion of the main urban zone of Lanzhou and of various county towns, with the increase in building-up land being most prominent. During this period, there were significant changes in the periphery of the core urban area and county towns in Lanzhou, with decreases moving from the urban center (the highest value) to the surrounding areas (Yongdeng County had the lowest value). The correlation between the HSE and population density grew stronger in Anning and Chengguan Districts but became weaker in Xigu and Qilihe Districts. Spatiotemporal variations in the HSE were primarily caused by climate change, followed by human activities, and were also influenced by the valley topography. Overall, the spatial distribution of population density and the HSE in Lanzhou demonstrated good consistency under the influence of economic development and urbanization.

AB  - Climate change is progressing rapidly and the impacts of climate change on people and nature are far reaching and are already being felt. Greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide (CO2), which cause global warming are known to be chemically highly stable and remain stagnant in the atmosphere for 50–300years and only once released into the atmosphere. Therefore, even if the whole world does not emit any GHGs, global warming is considered as a fateful thing that has to be progressed over a considerable period of time. Furthermore, while the amount of GHGs currently emitted by humankind is being sought to curb as much as possible under the IPCC-led international convention system, the absolute amount is expected to increase for a considerable time to come due to the explosive increase in emissions from the developing countries. Therefore, each region should find countermeasures to adapt and survive climate change to come in future in parallel with efforts to curb global warming by reducing GHGs emission. Based on the global carbon (C) budget, changing land use contributed significantly to increase in CO2 concentration in the air. Even in the results obtained in Korea, local climate change is closely related to land use. The difference of the atmospheric CO2 concentration collected in several areas around the world and within South Korea depended on the land use intensity of those areas. C budget by the local government in South Korea also reflected the trends. The spatial distribution of temperature in Seoul showed a close correlation with the spatial distribution of vegetation and it was also reflected on the phenology of the plants. These results indicate that land use intensity function as a critical factor causing climate change. Furthermore, these results suggest that reducing land use intensity through ecological restoration could be an important measure to adapt to climate change. In fact, stream restoration and creation of urban park in Seoul contributed to lowering the temperature and affected on the plant phenology. Although the vegetation achieved through ecological restoration is less than the physical or technical methods in terms of efficiency, it can supplement the low efficiency by displaying the multiple functions such as climate mitigation through CO2 absorption, temperature reduction, wind-proof climate control, aesthetic effects, etc. Moreover, ecological restoration can function as a real climate change adaptation measure because vegetation obtained from the ecological restoration has a long life and does not require management fees. In addition, this chapter introduces climate change adaptation policy and the legal basis adopted in Korea, the advanced cases of climate change adaptation measures, and UN decade on ecosystem restoration project as the future perspectives.

AB  - Scenario planning should be an effective tool for developing responses to climate change but will depend on ecological assessments of broad enough scope to support decision-making. Using climate projections from an ensemble of 16 models, we conducted an assessment of a midcontinental area of North America (Minnesota) based on a resistance, resilience, and facilitation framework. We assessed likely impacts and proposed options for eight landscape regions within the planning area. Climate change projections suggest that by 2069, average annual temperatures will increase 3°C with a slight increase in precipitation (6%). Analogous climate locales currently prevail 400–500km SSW. Although the effects of climate change may be resisted through intensive management of invasive species, herbivores, and disturbance regimes, conservation practices need to shift to facilitation and resilience. Key resilience actions include providing buffers for small reserves, expanding reserves that lack adequate environmental heterogeneity, prioritizing protection of likely climate refuges, and managing forests for multi-species and multi-aged stands. Modifying restoration practices to rely on seeding (not plants), enlarge seed zones, and include common species from nearby southerly or drier locales is a logical low-risk facilitation strategy. Monitoring “trailing edge” populations of rare species should be a high conservation priority to support decision-making related to assisted colonization. Ecological assessments that consider resistance, resilience, and facilitation actions during scenario planning is a productive first step towards effective climate change planning for biodiversity with broad applicability to many regions of the world.

AB  - Urban morphology, defined by the characteristics and spatial arrangement of urban structures, significantly affects urban microclimate in terms of thermal environments, wind dynamics, energy use, and outdoor air quality. Despite extensive research in this field, these effects are intensified by climate change and rapid urbanization, posing challenges to urban sustainability, such as poor air quality, increased energy demands, and pedestrian discomfort. While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer promising solutions for addressing these challenges, the field lacks standardized approaches for implementing these technologies. By leveraging urban morphology indicators such as sky view factor, building density, and green space ratio, AI models can analyze complex interactions across various spatiotemporal scales. However, significant variability in methodologies, indicators, and datasets limits the generalizability and applicability of these techniques. By synthesizing 111 studies over the last decade utilizing urban morphology and AI models to predict urban microclimate, this review aims to bridge these gaps and highlight AI’s unique potential to contribute to the field. Analyzed studies reported that key urban morphology indicators, particularly building density and height, explain up to 75% of land surface temperature variance across seasons, while sky view factor accounts for over 67% of heat exposure variations in urban environments, with these findings emerging from multiple independent investigations across diverse urban contexts. Random Forest emerges as the most widely adopted AI technique, demonstrating robust performance across different applications. Emerging trends, such as hybrid approaches combining AI with physics-based models, are highlighted as promising avenues for advancing the field. Our review identifies the need for standardized frameworks and datasets to enhance model applicability. The study presents actionable insights for climate-responsive urban planning and lays the groundwork for interdisciplinary studies, enabling the development of resilient, sustainable urban environments amid the growing challenges of urbanization and climate change.

AB  - Coastal wetland is a crucial part of the blue carbon ecosystem, having unique structural characteristics and serving both land and water functions. These areas also offer strong carbon sequestration and storage capacity. However, human activities and climate change have led to an ongoing decline in wetland areas. As an important wetland reserve in China, the coastal wetlands of Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, bring together a great number of water resources, land resources, biological resources, landscape resources, mineral resources, energy resources, and many other resources. However, in recent years, the coastal wetlands of Yancheng have also faced a continuous reduction in area. In this study, an integrated model of the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and multi-criteria evaluation-cellular automata-Markov (MCE-CA-Markov) model was designed to determine the importance of the driving factors of landscape pattern change and predict the landscape pattern of coastal wetlands in 2025, based on the analysis of landscape pattern changes in 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 in Yancheng coastal wetlands, Jiangsu Province. The results showed that the landscape configuration of coastal wetlands in Yancheng changed significantly during 2005–2020. The total natural wetland landscape area declined steadily over that 15-year span, showing a total decrease of 2.971×104 ha; on the contrary, the artificial wetlands increased. The analysis of the driving factors of wetland damage showed that gross domestic product (GDP), distance to roads, and average precipitation were the key factors. Based on this model, the natural wetland landscape of Yancheng’s coastal wetlands is predicted to decline sharply in 2025, and the wetland salt marsh vegetation will be extensively converted to aquaculture and agricultural land. Constructed land is predicted to increase significantly, and the trend of urban expansion is obvious. The study concludes with practical suggestions for the sustainable development and ecological conservation of the Yancheng coastal wetland ecosystem based on the predicted scenario.

AB  - The European Green Deal sets targets for biodiversity, climate change, sustainable farming, and rural development. For abandoned agricultural lands to contribute to these goals, specific policy measures to support appropriate land management are required. However, information is lacking on what these policies will mean for landowners and managers. This paper reviews the role of abandoned lands in European Union (EU) policies linked to the Green Deal. We interviewed 30 experts to identify the challenges faced by landowners in response to the identified policies and gather suggestions for future policy improvements. We found few explicit mentions of abandoned lands in policies. The potential of abandoned lands for alternative trajectories (beyond farming) was generally implicit. According to experts, landowners perceive the EU Common Agriculture Policy as the most influential to drive abandonment trajectories and support (or hinder) opportunities for re-management. The main challenges for landowners to (re-)use their lands included conflicting policies, lack of financial and technical support, and a feeling of disconnection with policies defined at EU level. To address the gap between objectives and implementation, policies need to secure support for landowners and managers. We provide three recommendations to uncover the potential of abandoned lands to contribute to the Green Deal targets: (1) increase their visibility in policies, (2) rely on an integrating policy approach, and (3) careful spatial planning to account for biophysical, socioeconomic, and cultural variations across regions.

AB  - The distribution of grassland communities significantly influences biodiversity conservation and resource management. Remote sensing datasets, such as Sentinel land cover images with high spatial and temporal resolution, have been commonly employed to simulate the distribution and community structure of plant species in grasslands. Nevertheless, the precision of grassland and community classification requires further enhancement for more effective grassland management. In response, our study presents a dynamic workflow for simulating the distribution of grassland plant species under different hydroclimatic conditions. Leveraging a random forest classifier with multi-source remote sensing features, we mapped the distribution of nine plant communities and six types of land cover in the upstream grasslands of the Xilingol River Basin, Inner Mongolia from 2017 to 2022. Utilizing the Google Earth Engine platform, our findings reveal a remarkable consistency in the overall spatiotemporal accuracy and classification precision of grassland communities across different years, even under varying hydroclimatic conditions. When critical features were carefully selected, the integration of Sentinel-1 (C-band synthetic aperture radar), Sentinel-2 (surface reflectance), SRTM DEM 30 m (Digital Elevation Model data), and MOD16A2.006 (evapotranspiration/latent heat flux product) data yielded a high overall accuracy ranging from 87.0 % to 89.5 % over multiple years. Our study not only determined the spatial patterns of various grassland plant communities but also explored the mechanism of their responses to different hydroclimatic conditions. The proposed approach holds practical implications for fine-scale grassland classification, providing valuable support for landscape classification and monitoring efforts. Furthermore, the insights derived from our findings offer valuable guidance for land managers and policymakers, aiding them in making informed decisions related to grassland conservation and sustainable land use planning.

AB  - A range of new spatial datasets classifying the European environment has been constructed over the last few years. These datasets share the common objective of dividing European environmental gradients into convenient units, within which objects and variables of interest have relatively homogeneous characteristics. The stratifications and typologies can be used as a basis for up-scaling, for stratified random sampling of ecological resources, for the representative selection of sites for studies across the continent and for the provision of frameworks for modeling exercises and reporting at the European scale. This paper provides an overview of five recent European stratifications and typologies, constructed for contrasting objectives, and differing in spatial and thematic detail. These datasets are: the Environmental Stratification (EnS), the European Landscape Classification (LANMAP), the Spatial Regional Reference Framework (SRRF), the Agri-Environmental Zonation (SEAMzones), and the Foresight Analysis for Rural Areas Of Europe (FARO-EU) Rural Typology. For each classification the objective, background, and construction of the dataset are described, followed by a discussion of its robustness. Finally, applications of each dataset are summarized. The five stratifications and typologies presented here give an overview of different research objectives for constructing such classifications. In addition they illustrate the most up to date methods for classifying the European environment, including their limitations and challenges. As such, they provide a sound basis for describing the factors affecting the robustness of such datasets. The latter is especially relevant, since there is likely to be further interest in European environmental assessment. In addition, advances in data availability and analysis techniques, will probably lead to the construction of other typologies in the future.

AB  - This study analyzes inter- and intra-zonal seasonal variability of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) within the methodological framework of local climate zones (LCZs) in three central European cities (Prague, Brno and Novi Sad). These cities differ in urban area and structure as well as in topography and hinterland land-cover features. LCZs were delineated on the basis of a GIS-based classification method. Land surface temperature (LST) was derived from LANDSAT-8 scenes in the period 2013–2018. The first step was to detect seasonal SUHI intensity differences for built LCZ types and LST for land-cover types of LCZ. The results revealed the highest differences in summer and spring, and lowest in winter. The highest SUHI intensity values occur in densely built-up and industrial zones, and the lowest in sparsely-built city outskirts. The coolest LCZs based on LST were dense trees and water areas in spring and summer. The second step aimed to analyze the effects of vegetation on SUHI formation. Hence, 11 land cover subclasses (from dense trees to bush/scrub) were defined in order to research intra-zonal seasonal LST variability. The height and density of vegetation have substantial effects on intra-zonal variability of LST in land-cover types of LCZ, whereas differences between forest subclasses were relatively low. Finally, the character of the vegetation had a substantial influence on intra-zonal LCZ variability of LST and SUHI formation. Further research in this field could contribute to better understanding of micro- and mezzo-climate-scale patterns, as well as better adaptation to climate change in urban areas.
