AB  - The ability to characterize hydrologically relevant differences between places is at the core of our science. A common way to quantitatively characterize hydrological catchments is through the use of descriptors that summarize relevant physical aspects of the system, typically by aggregating heterogeneous geospatial information into a single number. Such descriptors capture various facets of catchment functioning and structure, identify similarity or dissimilarity among catchments, and transfer hydrological information to unobserved locations. However, so far there is no agreement on how catchment descriptors should be selected, aggregated, and evaluated. Even worse, little is known about the existence of potential biases in the current practices to characterize catchments. In this systematic review, we analyze 742 research articles published between 1967 and 2021 to provide a categorized overview of current and historical practices of catchment characterization (i.e., data sources, aggregation and evaluation methods) in hydrological science and related disciplines. We uncover the existence of substantial biases in catchment characterization: (1) only 16% of the analyzed studies are in dry environments, even though such environments cover 42% of global land surface, suggesting that most catchment descriptors are tailored to represent energy-limited environments and are potentially less effective in water-limited environments; (2) only 30% of studies use subsurface features for catchment characterization despite the dominance of subsurface flow; (3) only 4% and 9% of descriptors are aggregated in spatially- and vertically-differentiated way, respectively, while the majority of descriptors are simple averages and do not account for hydrologically-relevant variabilities of features within catchments; (4) 25% of all studies analyzed do not evaluate the usefulness of catchment descriptors, and none quantifies their uncertainty. We demonstrate the potential effects of these biases on our ability to effectively characterize catchments and identify functional similarity of catchment behavior with illustrative examples. Finally, we suggest possible ways to derive more robust, comprehensive and hydrologically meaningful catchment descriptors.

AB  - Dead wood plays important structural and biogeochemical roles in forest ecosystem processes. Some aspects of woody debris dynamics have been carefully studied, but the decay patterns and carbon density of standing dead (SD) trees are only weakly characterized. Climbing forest mortality rates are also driving increases in the creation and abundance of SD trees. All forms of forest carbon accounting, from stand-level biomass calculations to dynamic earth systems models, are improved by a better understanding of SD tree physical and chemical traits. Using dimensional analysis, we described the patterns of density, carbon concentration, and net carbon density in decaying SD trees of six California mixed conifer species. As decay class advanced, trees showed a progressively lower density and a small increase in carbon concentration. Net carbon density of the most decayed SD trees was only 60% that of live trees. The key characteristics of SD trees that determine these patterns are species, surface to volume ratio, and relative position within the tree. The decay of SD trees and how deadwood biomass is estimated in large scale inventories also have repercussions in greenhouse gas accounting. When the measured changes in carbon density are applied to SD carbon stock estimates for California mixed conifer forests, the decay-adjusted estimates are 3.66–3.74Tg (18%) lower than estimates that do not incorporate change due to decay.

AB  - Spatial assessment of terroir is creating a new possibility for enhancement of high quality agro-food product and to minimize negative environmental effects such as soil degradation and associated risks. The classification and mapping of particular terroir units could be a competitive marketing tool with a major impact on farmers’ incomes. For this purpose, Carré and McBratney (2005) proposed the terron concept to establish combined soil and landscape entities as the first investigative step to identify terroirs. The main objective of the present work was to assemble various environmental factors (i.e. soil, terrain and climate), to identify and then to map terrons in Denmark. First, for representing soil factors, a national soil spectral library was utilized to measure taxonomic distances between 34 Danish reference soil profiles and the Danish national soil profile database (586 soil profiles). Second, the terrain and climate factors for each soil profile location were then compiled as represented by relative slope position, valley depth, valley bottom flatness, vertical distance to the channel network, number of frost days, annual number of growing days, global solar radiation, and precipitation. Third, nine Danish terron classes were established by fuzzy c-means clustering based on an integrated matrix including all soil, terrain and climate factors whereby each terron class is characterized by soil, terrain and climate as a whole entity. Finally, the spatial distribution of Danish terrons was mapped using Cubist regression rules. The results were compared with a soil map derived from the same profile database. We concluded that the map of terrons described natural environment quantitatively and formally in terms of soil, landscape and climatic information better than just a soil class or soil attribute map. Further investigations are needed to discover whether the terron classes give better predictions of landscape-dynamic processes and allow better management options than soil alone. This study also demonstrated several advantages of using soil spectral data and ancillary data to identify and map terrons. The next step will be to validate the terron map by incorporating crop yield data and social factors to delineate natural Danish terroir units.

The longitudinal connectivity of fluvial greenway is directly related to the natural flow of water, and is sensible and cognizable. The lateral Connectivity of fluvial greenway is closely linked to the Flood Pulse Concept and river cross-section design. The vertical connectivity of fluvial greenway refers to the vertical materials and energy circulation performance and the biocoenosis relevancy in the cross section of the river. They constitute the complicated continuum system of fluvial greenway.

AB  - Accurate and realistic characterizations of flood hazards on desert piedmonts and playas are increasingly important given the rapid urbanization of arid regions. Flood behavior in arid fluvial systems differs greatly from that of the perennial rivers upon which most conventional flood hazard assessment methods are based. Additionally, hazard assessments may vary widely between studies or even contradict other maps. This study's chief objective was to compare and evaluate landscape interpretation and hazard assessment between types of maps depicting assessments of flood risk in Ivanpah Valley, NV, as a case study. As a secondary goal, we explain likely causes of discrepancy between data sets to ameliorate confusion for map users. Four maps, including three different flood hazard assessments of Ivanpah Valley, NV, were compared: (i) a regulatory map prepared by FEMA, (ii) a soil survey map prepared by NRCS, (iii) a surficial geologic map, and (iv) a flood hazard map derived from the surficial geologic map, both of which were prepared by NBMG. GIS comparisons revealed that only 3.4% (33.9 km2) of Ivanpah Valley was found to lie within a FEMA floodplain, while the geologic flood hazard map indicated that ~44% of Ivanpah Valley runs some risk of flooding (Fig. 2D). Due to differences in mapping methodology and scale, NRCS data could not be quantitatively compared, and other comparisons were complicated by differences in flood hazard class criteria and terminology between maps. Owing to its scale and scope of attribute data, the surficial geologic map provides the most useful information on flood hazards for land-use planning. This research has implications for future soil geomorphic mapping and flood risk mitigation on desert piedmonts and playas. The Ivanpah Valley study area also includes the location of a planned new international airport, thus this study has immediate implications for urban development and land-use planning near Las Vegas, NV.

AB  - Braided rivers have been exploited for decades by humans for the multiple resources they can provide (sediment and water sources for example). This frequently induces physical and biological dysfunctions and endangers ecosystem services, adjacent human infrastructures, and population. Restoration operations are more frequently carried out to improve river status and functioning. However, monitoring post-restoration operations generally lasts a short time, and, in the case of braided rivers, monitoring methods are not adapted to their morphological specificities. This study demonstrates the usefulness of combining quantitative indices to evaluate restoration success, by using morphometric indices on undisturbed and restored braided reaches before and after restoration using ortho-rectified aerial photographs and elevation data. The objectives of this study are (i) to test the application of morphometric indices specifically developed for braided rivers, for the first time in a restoration context and on braided rivers highly impacted by human pressures, (ii) to assess the impact of spatial scale and data type on the indices used, in order to (iii) evaluate the restoration operations efficiency on the morphology of braided rivers. Two morphometric indices (normalised active channel width (Piégay et al., 2009) and bed relief index (Liébault et al., 2013)) were applied on nine river reaches in south-east France and northern Italy, including four that have been restored or are still under restoration. Restoration operations were diverse but mainly process-based, from weir lowering to active channel widening and gravel augmentation. Operations date from 2008 to present. Active channel width and braiding morphological pattern improved after restoration (overall improvement of 79 % and 67 %, respectively for the two indices). Changes were supported or initiated by morphogenic floods occurrence on two out of the four restored reaches. This study shows that morphometric indices can be used to assess restoration efficiency and spatial trajectories of braided rivers through time. It also demonstrates the significance of integrating restoration operations within a broader geomorphological context of the river catchment at the regional scale.

AB  - Accurate Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) are inevitable inputs for mapping and analyzing areas subject to natural hazards. Topographic airborne laser scanning has become an established technique to characterize the Earth's surface: lidar provides 3D point clouds allowing for a fine reconstruction of the topography while preserving high frequencies of the relief. For flood hazard modeling, the key step, before going onto terrain modeling, is the discrimination of land and water areas within the delivered point clouds. Therefore, instantaneous shorelines, river banks, and inland waters can be extracted as a basis for more reliable DTM generation. This paper presents an automatic, efficient, and versatile workflow for land/water classification of airborne topographic lidar points, effective at large scales (>300km2). For that purpose, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is used as a classification framework and it is embedded in a workflow designed for our specific goal. First, a restricted but carefully designed set of features, based only on 3D lidar point coordinates and flightline information, is defined as classifier input. Then, the SVM learning step is performed on small but well-targeted areas thanks to a semi-automatic region growing strategy. Finally, label probability output by SVM is merged with contextual knowledge during a probabilistic relaxation step in order to remove pixel-wise misclassification. Results show that a survey of hundreds of millions of points are labeled with high accuracy (>95% in most cases for coastal areas, and >90% for rivers) and that small natural and anthropic features of interest are still well classified even though we work at low point densities (0.5–4pts/m2). We also noticed that it may fail in water-logged areas. Nevertheless, our approach remains valid for regional and national mapping purposes, coasts and rivers, and provides a strong basis for further discrimination of land-cover classes and coastal habitats.

AB  - Species distribution model (SDMs) is increasingly used to determine the distribution range of individual species and identify biodiversity hotspots. Of many technical issues, model over-fitting or over-parameterization is a major concern, which can lead to severe under-prediction. However, under-fitting and over-prediction may also occur if species requirements for environment are inadequately modeled. We used the collection data of stoneflies (Plecoptera, Insecta) from Illinois, USA to examine how often and severely maximum entropy (Maxent) over- or under-predicts species richness and species-occurrence frequency. A recently proposed AICc-based method (Warren and Seifert, 2011) was used for model-complexity control or regularization. Twenty-nine historically well-sampled watersheds were used to validate the predictions. The standard models, which used the default regularization (β=1), over- or under-predicted, depending on the watershed, species, and threshold used for converting suitability score into species presence–absence. The AICc-selected models (β=7–40) used 77% less parameters, but often strongly and consistently over-predicted. Three thresholds, equal training sensitivity and specificity, maximizing training sensitivity and specificity (MTSS) and minimum training presence, yielded most accurate estimates. Accordingly, we developed standard models for 41 species and identified the historically species-rich watersheds in Illinois. Our results offer new insight into the effects of regularization and choices of thresholds on Maxent performances.

AB  - The multi-pattern approach (MPA) is a new method that has been applied to understand the transition to integrated flood risk management (IFRM) in the Netherlands. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the outcomes of the 2.3 billion Euro flood safety programme Room for the River (RftR). 2 years of research, 55 interviews, a survey of 155 respondents and elaborate document analysis, provided in-depth evidence of how the transition occurred in practice. Experiments were scaled-up, IFRM was consolidated in national policies, and the implementation of RftR further adapted the functioning of the societal system. Lessons are drawn that enrich the MPA framework and that can help its further development and application. The MPA provides scientists with a method to analyse transition dynamics as a chain of patterns that occur under certain conditions. Policy makers can shape and monitor the outcomes that are to be generated to support a transition.

AB  - The European Landscape Convention (ELC) calls for the definition of ‘landscape quality objectives’ (LQO) as “the formulation by the competent public authorities of the aspirations of the public with regard to the landscape features of their surroundings”. However, it is not yet defined how the integration of the visions of the public should be carried out. Notably in regions with poor participatory culture and in rural landscapes abandoned by people and consequently by their activities, dealing with the future does not seem a straightforward task. In these marginal rural landscapes the role of agriculture is being altered under the influence of the new rationale of the Common Agriculture Policy, so it may have to assume different functions in the future. Thus, this paper aims at showing how the development of ‘exploratory landscape scenarios’ can be a useful tool, firstly to find plausible landscape futures, and secondly to trigger discussions with the public regarding their aspirations for their landscape. The development procedure for ‘exploratory landscape scenarios’ builds on the ‘intuitive logics’ approach that focuses on the production of a variety of scenarios as starting point for discussion about the future rather than on finding an optimal one, which can limit the options unnecessarily from the beginning. The methodological approach is illustrated at a local scale by using the case study of Mértola in southeast Portugal. The results of the scenario exercise point out the adequateness of the methodology in the development of futures that are perceived as plausible by local stakeholders and, thereby, able to bring out their desires and threats towards the future of their landscape.

AB  - Forests in their later stages of development attain attributes that support biodiversity and provide a variety of ecological benefits (e.g. clean water and carbon storage). Despite their values, old-growth forests are declining worldwide in part due to anthropogenic pressures. A persistent challenge to managing and conserving old-growth forest has been establishing a reliable method for measuring old-growth values across large landscapes at an appropriately fine ecological and spatial scale. Using data from a community-managed forest in central British Columbia, Canada, an Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) based metric was developed, using a random forest modeling framework, to predict an old-growth index across the forest. Using this old-growth index, we estimated that forests with “Very-high” old-growth values cover 14.7% of the study area (18,183.2 ha), and that only 25% (4,545.9 ha) of this “very-high” old growth value areas are current inside designated old-growth management areas (OGMAs). Additionally, the forests with “very-high” old-growth values that are currently inside OGMAs are fragmented, as only 1 out of 40 OGMAs have more than 50% of its area covered by forests with “Very-high” old-growth value. This research provides a clear ecological indicator that uses fine-scale remotely sensed data to measure old-growth and assess its conservation status within reserves. While the index developed is specific to the study site, the framework, is generic enough to be adapted to other forest types and ecosystems. More importantly, the identification of the amount and location of old-growth forests over the landscape can aid in the management and conservation of this rare resource and its services.

AB  - In old-growth forests, natural disturbances form a complex mosaic of structures, providing a wide diversity of habitats and functions of great importance. Old-growth forests are still often seen as a homogeneous whole and few remote-sensing approaches have been tested to identify their structural diversity, especially in boreal forests. The aim of this study is to use a combination of airborne LiDAR and satellite imagery to identify and discriminate old-growth forest structures resulting from different disturbance histories. The study area, which was located in the mixed boreal forest of Quebec (Canada), is Monts Valin National Park and adjacent managed territories. Balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill) is the dominant species in the study area, but hardwood species such as white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) can also be abundant in the early succession stages. Four forest classes were studied: second-growth (logged between 1970 and 1980); transition old-growth (burned in 1920); undisturbed old-growth (unburned for at least 125 years); and disturbed old-growth forest (unburned for at least 125 years, but severely disturbed by an insect outbreak around 1980). A multivariate Random Forest model was used to discriminate the classes on 6466 1 ha tiles, based on 11 complementary LiDAR and satellite-derived indices describing stand vertical and horizontal structure, together with “greenness” and disturbance history over the last 30 years. This model had high predictive efficiency (AUC = 94.2), with 81.8% of the tiles accurately classified. Interestingly, undisturbed old-growth forests exhibited intermediate characteristics compared to transition and disturbed old-growth forests. This emphasizes that some structural attributes recognized as important for the classification of temperate and tropical old-growth forests, such as high vertical complexity, are of lesser relevance for boreal old-growth forests. In comparison to undisturbed old-growth forests, transition old-growth forests had a taller canopy of high “greenness” due to a greater hardwood abundance; disturbed old-growth forests had a higher gap fraction and heterogeneity in tree size; second-growth forests exhibited a lower and more even canopy. Misclassified tiles were explained by spatial variation in disturbance severity or different levels of forest resistance and resilience to disturbance. These misclassifications are also of ecological interest, as they highlight the nuances in structural diversity that are rarely identified by disturbance mapping. A reasonable combination of LiDAR and satellite indices was effective not only in discriminating old-growth forests from second-growth forests, but also identifying their different structures, which result from specific disturbance histories. This method could contribute to effective monitoring of changes in the areas and characteristics old-growth forest that are caused by anthropogenic and natural disturbances.

AB  - Remote sensing-based analyses of vegetation function such as photosynthesis and productivity are challenging in wetlands with complex cover and difficult field access. Recent advances in object-based image analysis (OBIA) and machine-learning algorithms offer new image classification tools; however, few comparisons of different approaches have been discussed to date. We applied OBIA to delineate wetland plant functional types (PFTs) for Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China and Ramsar wetland conservation site, from a spring 2008 Landsat TM image. We targeted major PFTs that represent dominant vegetation groups along wetland inundation gradients and affect ecosystem biogeochemical cycles and ecological habitats. Classification results were compared among: a) several “small” object segmentation scales (with average object sizes 1350–9000m2); b) algorithms from six families of statistical machine-learning classifiers (Bayesian, Logistic, Neural Network, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines) and c) two hierarchical levels of vegetation classification, a generalized 3-class set and a more specific 6-class set. We also examined the response of classification accuracy to four basic object-level texture metrics. The highest accuracies (>85–90%) and best agreement among algorithms occurred at coarser object scales rather than close-to-pixel scales. No single machine-learning algorithm was consistently superior at all scales, although support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor and artificial neural network most frequently provided the highest overall and PFT-specific accuracies. Including texture metrics had both positive and negative low-magnitude effects on classification accuracy that were not consistent among scale values, algorithms or PFT classes. Individual PFTs differed in scales at which they were best discriminated from others, reflecting their unique landscape positions, ecology of dominant species and disturbance agents. There was a 29–35% disagreement between mapped areas of generalized PFTs and their respective subclasses, suggesting potential mismatches between the ecological classification scheme and PFT landscape patch structure, and raising concern on error propagation in multi-scale classifications. We conclude that OBIA with machine-learning classifiers is useful for landscape vegetation analyses, however, considerations of spatial scale and image segmentation outcomes are critical in mapping PFTs and should be more thoroughly investigated in future work.

AB  - The link between individual variation in resource selection (e.g., functional response) and fitness creates a foundation for understanding wildlife-habitat relationships. Although many anthropogenic activities adversely affect these relationships, it is largely unknown whether projects implemented to benefit wildlife populations actually achieve this outcome. For sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) obligate species such as the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse), expansion of juniper (Juniperus spp.) and pinyon-pine (Pinus spp.; conifers) woodlands into sagebrush ecosystems has been identified as a conservation threat. This threat is intensified when a sagebrush ecosystem is bounded by naturally unsuitable habitats. As such, federal, state, and private land managers have implemented landscape-level management to remove conifers on thousands of hectares of sagebrush habitat across the western United States. Despite the scale of contemporary conifer treatments, little was previously known whether sage-grouse will occupy these manipulated landscapes and whether occupancy has consequences on fitness components. To address these questions, we monitored nest and brood success rates for 96 radio-marked sage-grouse from 2012-2015 that inhabited conifer-dominated landscapes in the Box Elder Sage-grouse Management Area in Utah where mechanical conifer removal projects were completed. We then linked sage-grouse resource selection to individual nest (n = 95) and brood (n = 56) success by incorporating random-slope Resource Selection Functions as explanatory predictors in a logistic brood success model. Using the novel approach of random slope covariates, we demonstrated that sage-grouse selected for nest and brooding sites closer to conifer removal areas and that the probability of individual nest and brood success declined (β = −0.10 and β = −0.74, respectively) as sage-grouse females selected sites farther from conifer removal areas. Our research provided the first evidence that mechanical conifer removal treatments can increase suitable available breeding habitats for female sage-grouse and that individuals who occupied these areas experienced enhanced nest and brood success.

AB  - This paper develops a methodology to map the two main rice types in northwest Bangladesh from 1989 to 2016, when Green Revolution technologies and policies resulted in a 300% rice area expansion and localised unsustainable groundwater use. The mapping is performed for the largely irrigated dry season Boro rice (grown from November/December to May/June), and the largely rainfed Aman rice (grown from June/July to October/November). The petabyte archive of Landsat reflectance data available via Google Earth Engine is used to extract monthly time-series of two remotely sensed vegetation indices – the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Global Vegetation Moisture Index (GVMI) – which can capture crop phenological dynamics as they correlate during crop growth stages and can be used to discriminate standing water when EVI is low and GVMI is high. This feature is exploited to detect the effects of flooding before transplanting Boro rice in January and to capture the late phenological phases of Aman rice through harvesting months (October to November). A gap-filled and smoothed EVI and GVMI monthly time-series sequences for both rice cropping months are grouped using machine learning unsupervised K-means clustering into clusters (25 used here), and manually aggregated using crop calendars and local expert knowledge into rice types, other vegetated areas, water, non-permanent water and bare areas. A representative subset of these data are then used to construct a training sample using additional covariates besides the monthly EVI and GVMI values and train a Random Forest (RF) model capable of predicting the land cover types in other years. The resulting RF maps for the two cropping seasons were evaluated against publicly available survey crop statistics (from 1989 to 2016) and published Boro 30 m resolution maps for 2013 to 2016. The maps provide qualitative evidence that unsustainable groundwater extractions can be linked to Boro rice irrigation in some parts of northwest Bangladesh. Further research, using these maps and other hydrological data, is required to quantitatively assess when, where, and how much irrigation contributes to unsustainable groundwater use. The results show that the methodology can accurately (generally within 20% absolute error) capture Boro and Aman rice over the Green Revolution period, and other landscape dynamic characteristics of importance for environmental assessments, such as areas of standing water.

The research shows that: Construction of Huitengxile wind farm has three main effects to ecological environment of the region. First, construction of wind farm affects precipitation in the region, causing reduction of water area. Second, fan base area and fan overhaul route due to artificial construction or vehicle rolling during operation of wind farm will cause reduction of grassland area. Third, new irregular fan overhaul route separates large grassland to smaller patches, increasing fragmentation and shape complexity of landscape and reducing dominance of the grassland, which will further weaken the control effect of natural facts such grassland to the landscape and reduce the stability of ecological system in the region.

AB  - Improved understanding and prediction of the fundamental environmental controls on ecosystem service supply across the landscape will help to inform decisions made by policy makers and land-water managers. To evaluate this issue for a local catchment case study, we explored metrics and spatial patterns of service supply for water quality regulation, agriculture production, carbon storage, and biodiversity for the Macronutrient Conwy catchment. Methods included using ecosystem models such as LUCI and JULES, integration of national scale field survey datasets, earth observation products and plant trait databases, to produce finely resolved maps of species richness and primary production. Analyses were done with both 1×1km gridded and subcatchment data. A common single gradient characterised catchment scale ecosystem services supply with agricultural production and carbon storage at opposing ends of the gradient as reported for a national-scale assessment. Species diversity was positively related to production due to the below national average productivity levels in the Conwy combined with the unimodal relationship between biodiversity and productivity at the national scale. In contrast to the national scale assessment, a strong reduction in water quality as production increased was observed in these low productive systems. Various soil variables were tested for their predictive power of ecosystem service supply. Soil carbon, nitrogen, their ratio and soil pH all had double the power of rainfall and altitude, each explaining around 45% of variation but soil pH is proposed as a potential metric for ecosystem service supply potential as it is a simple and practical metric which can be carried out in the field with crowd-sourcing technologies now available. The study emphasises the importance of considering multiple ecosystem services together due to the complexity of covariation at local and national scales, and the benefits of exploiting a wide range of metrics for each service to enhance data robustness.

AB  - The marine benthic cyanobacteria of the Iles Eparses, Mozambique Channel, were surveyed for the first time. A total of 39 species are reported: 29 from Europa, 17 from Glorioso and 23 from Juan de Nova Islands. The higher biodiversity in Europa is explained by greater habitat diversity on this Island with unique ecosystems (mangroves, fossil reefs, pools). Average species richness varied between the geomorphological habitat types with higher diversity in shallow environments (fossil reef pools, mangroves, reef flats), which are characterized by high temperatures and high irradiances. The most common species observed on the three islands were Hydrocoleum coccineum, Hydrocoleum glutinosum, Hydrocoleum lyngbyaceum, Phormidium laysanense, Lyngbya sordida, and Symploca hydnoides; which are also the dominant species observed in the Southwest Indian Ocean region. The most frequent species was Phormidium laysanense with extensive cover observed in the northwest of Juan de Nova Island. Our study provided a comparison between the cyanobacterial flora of Iles Eparses and the recorded surveys in the Southwest Indian Ocean region. The low similarity observed between these species lists could be explained by differences in sampling strategies and efforts, as well as by different taxonomic approaches employed in past regional studies.

AB  - Conservation assessment based on complex species distribution models suffers from a number of conceptual drawbacks when applied to setting conservation priorities. The rule-based model described in this paper uses a set of simple and easily understood ecological rules developed in consultation with local ecologists that are directly applicable to the local landscape. The model determines the suitability for the expansion of target semi-natural habitats, modified by landscape differences, for a selected study site in Wales, UK. The results in a pilot study area for semi-natural broadleaf woodland (SNBW) indicated that the model successfully identifies potential sites for expansion at the scale of the land parcel that represents the dominant management unit. The model generated high suitability scores for broadleaf woodland expansion along river valleys which contain proportionately more remnant broadleaf woodland and other semi-natural vegetation than other, more intensively farmed parts of the contemporary landscape. The results demonstrate that within this landscape type there is the potential to increase woodland area by c. 6.5%. By contrast a landscape type characterised by gentle relief and deep fertile soils currently under intensive agricultural use, shows the potential for lower levels of broadleaf woodland expansion equivalent to c. 3.3% of the area of the landscape unit. The model is flexible and can be re-run to reflect changed circumstances, in particular changes in policy relating to agri-environment targets for habitats and species. Future work is required to refine the model to reflect differences in the cultural as well as the physical characteristics of the underlying landscape.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Desertification is the diminution or destruction of the biological potential of land and can ultimately lead to desert-like conditions. It is an aspect of the widespread deterioration of ecosystems under the combined pressure of adverse and fluctuating climate and excessive exploitation. Such pressure has diminished or destroyed the biological potential for multiple purposes at a time when increased productivity is needed to support growing populations in the quest for development. Desertification produces many changes in the ecosystems of a region and is recognized primarily by the physical changes in the environment, including the reduction of plant cover, soil loss, loss of soil organic matter, deposition of sand bodies, and increased run-off. In extreme cases, desertification can result in marked reduction in vegetative cover and loss of soil by water and wind erosion. Not all desertified regions suffer a loss of primary productivity. Human activities that alter the ocean–atmosphere interactions, that change atmospheric and stratospheric chemistry, and that alter land surface–atmosphere interactions directly affect regional climates around the world. One of the major biological challenges of the 21st century is the resolution of the relationship between the diversity of organisms in ecosystems and the long-term behavior of those ecosystems. There are four prevalent hypotheses concerning this relationship: the diversity–stability hypothesis, the rivet hypothesis, the redundancy hypothesis, and the idiosyncratic response hypothesis.

AB  - Net greenhouse gas (GHG) source strength for agricultural wetland ecosystems in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is currently unknown. In particular, information is lacking to constrain spatial variability associated with GHG emissions (CH4, CO2, and N2O). GHG fluxes typically vary with edaphic, hydrologic, biologic, and climatic factors. In the PPR, characteristic wetland plant communities integrate hydropedologic factors and may explain some variability associated with trace gas fluxes at ecosystem and landscape scales. We addressed this question for replicate wetland basins located in central North Dakota stratified by hydropedologic vegetation zone on Jul 12 and Aug 3, 2003. Data were collected at the soil-atmosphere interface for six plant zones: deep marsh, shallow marsh, wet meadow, low prairie, pasture, and cropland. Controlling for soil moisture and temperature, CH4 fluxes varied significantly with zone (p<0.05). Highest CH4 emissions were found near the water in the deep marsh (277,800 μg m−2 d−1 CH4), which declined with distance from water to −730 μg m−2 d−1 CH4 in the pasture. Carbon dioxide fluxes also varied significantly with zone. Nitrous oxide variability was greater within zones than between zones, with no significant effects of zone, moisture, or temperature. Data were extrapolated for a 205.6 km2 landscape using a previously developed synoptic classification for PPR plant communities. For this landscape, we found croplands contributed the greatest proportion to the net GHG source strength on Jul 12 (45,700 kg d−1 GHG-C equivalents) while deep marsh zones contributed the greatest proportion on Aug 3 (26,145 kg d−1 GHG-C equivalents). This was driven by a 30-fold reduction in cropland N2O–N emissions between dates. The overall landscape average for each date, weighted by zone, was 462.4 kg km−2 d−1 GHG-C equivalents on Jul 12 and 314.3 kg km−2 d−1 GHG-C equivalents on Aug 3. Results suggest GHG fluxes vary with hydropedologic soil zone, particularly for CH4, and provide initial estimates of net GHG emissions for heterogeneous agricultural wetland landscapes.

AB  - Landscape sensitivity may be discussed in terms of the response of landscape systems to perturbation on different time and spatial scales. Unstable systems behave chaotically but may show self organised criticality, while stable systems resist change until threshold values of system parameters are exceeded. Spatial sensitivity is expressed in different rates of change, between landscape components or elements. This leads to divergence between landscape elements, and the inheritance of palaeoforms in present-day landscape mosaics. Temporal sensitivity reflects the magnitude and frequency of individual events nested within patterns of longer term environmental changes occurring on different timescales. The resulting landscape complexity reflects the spatio-temporal sensitivity of earth surface systems over ten orders of scale magnitude. The connectivity within landscapes ensures that site instabilities can be propagated within multievent feedback systems. Landscapes record their own histories in sediments and soils, but interpretation of event stratigraphy may not be straightforward, while soil profiles can absorb individual events without erosion. Although we are increasingly able to model the present, environmental management is dominantly about conserving inherited properties of landscapes: forests, soils, floodplains, coastlines. Landscape sensitivity for landscape management must, therefore, address not only active, largely nonlinear, environmental systems, but also the mosaics and palimpsests that are the inheritance from past environments.

AB  - Due to a continuous increase in human activities occurring throughout marine and coastal areas worldwide (e.g., marine traffic and construction), the lack of in-depth information on vast marine areas is problematic. However, the spatial informatics field has enabled the development of new applications based on pre-existing spatial data. This paper discusses the physical structure and complexity of the continental shelf seafloor, using geospatial modelling and GIS analysis to gain insight into the physical environment of the Baltic Sea seafloor as a basis for ecosystem management. We demonstrate the mapping of coherent features over a broad region and identify geomorphic features of the seabed by analysing and modelling bathymetric, seabed substrate, and photic depth datasets. The analysis was performed at the kilometre scale using a grid size of 200 m. In total, 18 unique seabed geomorphic features were identified from the entire Baltic Sea (including the Skagerrak). The features are similar to geomorphic seafloor structures typically occurring on glaciated continental shelves. The Baltic Sea is primarily characterized by various plains and basins, and on average, one-third of the seafloor can be regarded as a sediment accumulation area. Other seabed geomorphic features are mainly present in certain local sub regions. The archipelagos as well as the coastal areas of southern Sweden and the Bothnian Bay have a heterogeneous seafloor environment. These areas are characterized by sea valleys and holes, sea troughs, and bedrock elevations, partly due to a crystalline basement and glacial erosion. In addition, the shallow coastal areas suffer from intense wave exposure and have erosional features that differ from those in open sea areas. Effective transnational marine spatial planning requires extensive knowledge of the environmental characteristics of the region in question. Background data for marine spatial planning can be obtained through an analysis of seabed geomorphic features, which provides consistent information on the physical marine environment over a broad area.

AB  - Society has always benefited from ecosystems through the provision of ecosystem services. To ensure a continuous flow of these benefits, different strategies aimed at safeguarding ecosystem services are proposed. In this paper we explore how biodiversity conservation measures, particularly protected areas, influence the flow of ecosystem services to different members of society. We highlight the impact of these measures on the poorer members of society because of their strong dependence on ecosystem services to sustain their livelihood. For the Democratic Republic of Congo we mapped five ecosystem services (food production, tourism, carbon, timber and fuel wood production) using spatial landscape indicators, within and outside protected areas, and identified their direct beneficiaries. This illustration was used to feed a round-table discussion on the impact of different conservation strategies on society, held with ecosystem services professionals during the 4th Ecosystem Service Partnership Conference in the Netherlands. The discussion highlighted the need for spatial methods to assess ecosystem service trade-offs, as well as the main challenges for conservation measures to contribute to both livelihood improvement and conservation gains. We argue that, ecosystem services maps can play a crucial role in understanding and managing the trade-offs in ecosystem service flows resulting from conservation strategies.

AB  - Water utilities incentivize turf replacement to promote water conservation, but the effects of such programs have received limited evaluations. In 2014, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) undertook an unprecedented investment to incentive turf replacement throughout Southern California in response to a serious Statewide drought. MWD devoted $350 million to the program, resulting in more than 46,000 rebate payments (25,000 in Los Angeles County) to remove 15.3 million square meters of turf. The program implementation provided a unique opportunity to address research gaps on turf replacement implementation. We analyzed socioeconomic and spatial trends of program participants and assessed landscape changes from turf replacement using a random sample of properties (4% of LA County participants in 2014–16). Specifically, we used a novel and cost-effective approach Google Earth Street View to characterize landscapes in front yards and created a typology of land cover types. Results showed: post-replacement landscapes had a diversity of land cover types – diverse yards with several land cover types, as well as more homogenous yards with a single land cover such as woodchips, bare soil, gravel, and artificial turf. Analysis also indicated some evidence of “neighborhood adoption” effects. We describe the need for longitudinal studies to understand long-term effects of turf replacement and associated water use, and suggest that water utilities should also evaluate results in backyards, which requires site visits. This study provides a novel contribution that can be replicated over space and time to further knowledge of turf replacement program implementations and evaluation.

Study focus
Reservoir construction is one of the major contributors to changes in natural river flow regime characteristics. This study aims to understand the hydrological alterations resulting from the construction of reservoirs and water abstraction in the upper regions of the basin. The impacts of dams on river flow regimes where data is available only for periods after the construction of the dams is assessed. A landscape-based hydrological model, FLEX-Topo, is used to model the flows contributed by the upstream and downstream areas of four major reservoirs in the study area. A separate reservoir operation model is developed for each of the reservoirs. Next, the hydrological model is integrated with the reservoir model and the modelled flow at the downstream streamflow gauging station of each of the corresponding four sub-basins is calibrated. The modelled flow regimes with and without reservoirs are then compared using the indicators of hydrological alterations to understand the degree to which the flows have been altered by the reservoirs.
New hydrological insights for the region
The results indicate that flow regimes have been modified from their natural state following reservoir impoundment and water abstractions. Significant impacts are observed in median monthly flow, 1-day minimum flow and low pulses. Such information could provide a reference to water managers to replicate the natural flow regimes, help sustain natural biota and thus contribute toward the sustainable management of river basins in India.

AB  - The Three-North Shelter Forest Program (TNSFP) in China has been intensely invested for approximately 40 years. However, the efficacy of the TNSFP has been debatable due to the spatiotemporal complexity of vegetation changes. A novel framework was proposed for characterizing vegetation changes in the TNSFP region through Combining Trend and Temporal Similarity trajectory (COTTS). This framework could automatically and continuously address the fundamental questions on where, what, how and when vegetation changes have occurred. Vegetation trend was measured by a non-parametric method. The temporal similarity trajectory was tracked by the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance of the inter-annual vegetation indices temporal profiles and modeled using the logistic function. The COTTS approach was applied to examine the afforestation efforts of the TNSFP using 500 m 8-day composites MODIS datasets from 2001 to 2015. Accuracy assessment from the 1109 reference sites reveals that the COTTS is capable of automatically determining vegetation dynamic patterns, with an overall accuracy of 90.08% and a kappa coefficient of 0.8688. The efficacy of the TNSFP was evaluated through comprehensive considerations of vegetation, soil and wetness. Around 45.78% areas obtained increasing vegetation trend, 2.96% areas achieved bare soil decline and 4.50% areas exhibited increasing surface wetness. There were 4.49% areas under vegetation degradation & desertification. Spatiotemporal heterogeneity of efficacy of the TNSFP was revealed: great vegetation gain through the abrupt dynamic pattern in the semi-humid and humid regions, bare soil decline & potential efficacy in the semi-arid region and remarkable efficacy in functional region of Eastern Ordos.

AB  - There is an imperfect symmetry between the patterns of channel evolution observed during laboratory flume experiments and those which materialize in rivers exposed to ambient environmental conditions that produce hydrogeomorphic fluxes which are more complex, contingent, and unpredictable. One strategy to improve our understanding of short- to medium-term channel evolution is to study landscapes that have undergone significant disturbance and have had their biogeomorphic templates reset to a known condition — in effect, creating a flume in nature. This study adopts a diagnostic state-and-transition framework to narrate and document baseline hypotheses for the potential evolutionary trajectories Clark Fork River, near Milltown, Montana. Following dam removal and remediation, a 5-km stretch of the Clark Fork River and its adjoining floodplain were reconstructed. Since flow was introduced to the newly constructed channel in December 2010, complex evolutionary trajectories have been observed on the Clark Fork's mainstem, its secondary channels, and floodplain. Focusing particularly on the river's secondary channels, this paper develops a typology of channel states that have been observed and demonstrates that multiple adjustment trajectories have materialized, sometimes within the same channel. A diagnostic state-and-transition framework offers a parsimonious strategy to quantitatively or qualitatively anticipate the influence of water, sediment, and ecological fluxes on channel evolution at the basin, reach, or segment scale. It provides environmental agencies with a robust method to devise spatially explicit scenario-based management plans for rivers in a variety of geomorphic settings.

AB  - Temporal variation patterns of Land Surface Temperature (LST) under different time scales are crucial in understanding the response of urban thermal environment to different forcings. However, there is no integrated toolset to extract such patterns from satellite remotely sensed time series LST (TSLST) data. This paper presents a workflow to extract the multi-timescale temporal patterns and dynamics from nonlinear and non-stationary TSLST data by taking Wuhan, China as case study. The 8-day MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite image products spanning the 2003–2017 period are used to generate a TSLST dataset with continuous and smooth surfaces on the monthly basis through the non-parametric Multi-Task Gaussian Process Modeling (MTGP). The study area is segmented into multiple time series clusters by k-means to bridge with urban planning in terms of research and implementation scale. Then, temporal patterns including annual, interannual components, and overall trends are reconstructed based on the components with characteristic time scales decomposed by the adaptive Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method. The generated patterns of the 17 time series clusters are interpreted from the perspective of earth revolution, meteorological cycles and urbanization. Specifically, the annual components which are mainly generated by earth revolution reveal consistent rhythmic patterns among the time series. The interannual components preserve similar shapes although they differ in amplitudes. The overall shape is basically consistent with that of air temperature of Central China, which may be mainly induced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. The overall trends which exert considerable differences are grouped into three types by shape. Such differences may be potentially caused by the inconsistent levels of localized urbanization, afforestation or circular economy development. This study facilitates the understanding of TSLST patterns and human-environment interactions. The proposed workflow can be utilized for other cities and potentially used for comparison among different cities.

AB  - A spatially-explicit model (Hydro-MEM model) that couples astronomic tides and Spartina alterniflora dynamics was developed to examine the effects of sea-level rise on salt marsh productivity in northeast Florida. The hydrodynamic component of the model simulates the hydroperiod of the marsh surface driven by astronomic tides and the marsh platform topography, and demonstrates biophysical feedback that non- uniformly modifies marsh platform accretion, plant biomass, and water levels across the estuarine landscape, forming a complex geometry. The marsh platform accretes organic and inorganic matter depending on the sediment load and biomass density which are simulated by the ecological-marsh component (MEM) of the model and are functions of the hydroperiod. Two sea-level rise projections for the year 2050 were simulated: 11cm (low) and 48cm (high). Overall biomass density increased under the low sea-level rise scenario by 54% and declined under the high sea-level rise scenario by 21%. The biomass-driven topographic and bottom friction parameter updates were assessed by demonstrating numerical convergence (the state where the difference between biomass densities for two different coupling time steps approaches a small number). The maximum coupling time steps for low and high sea-level rise cases were calculated to be 10 and 5 years, respectively. A comparison of the Hydro-MEM model with a parametric marsh equilibrium model (MEM) indicates improvement in terms of spatial pattern of biomass distribution due to the coupling and dynamic sea-level rise approaches. This integrated Hydro-MEM model provides an innovative method by which to assess the complex spatial dynamics of salt marsh grasses and predict the impacts of possible future sea level conditions.

AB  - The assessment of the value of ecosystem services is a valuable tool for biodiversity conservation that can facilitate better environmental policy decision-making and land management, and can help land managers develop interventions to compensate for biodiversity loss at the patch level. Previous studies have suggested that it is appropriate to assess the value of biodiversity for conservation planning by considering both the condition of the landscape and the spatial configuration of adjacent land uses that can be reflected as a proximity effect. This research examines the influence of spatial proximity on biodiversity conservation from the ecosystem service perspective based on the assumption that the variation in the proximity effect caused by land cover change has positive or negative impacts on ecological services. Three factors related to the spatial characteristics of the landscape were considered in this approach: the relative artificiality of the land cover types, the distance decay effect of patches and the impact of one land cover type on others. The proximity effect change (PEC) parameter reflected the relationship between the spatial proximity effect and biodiversity conservation. The results of a quantitative and spatial comparative analysis of the proposed method and the conventional method in Yingkou for the periods of 2000–2005 and 2005–2010 showed that the former can account for the temporal and spatial changes in ecosystem services for biodiversity conservation that were caused by patch-level changes as well as the interaction between the altered and adjacent patches from a spatial perspective. The metric can also identify the most critical areas for biodiversity protection and inform the efficient allocation of limited land resources for nature conservation to maximize the benefit to biodiversity by guiding the process of land-use change, particularly urbanization and agriculture. Future studies should focus on the other important factors that are applicable to the assessment of the value of biodiversity conservation in socio-ecological systems, where society and nature are mutually capable of fulfilling their roles.

AB  - Multimetric indices (MMI) are extremely useful indicators of anthropogenic disturbance, but that usefulness is a function of how well they have been calibrated for natural spatial and temporal variability. Nonetheless, there have been very few studies regarding the effects of such natural variability on MMI scores and metric selection, and even fewer studies on the effects of minimizing the mean of metric correlations. To do so, we calibrated and validated several adjusted and unadjusted MMI for natural gradients with different metric compositions via datasets from 161 samples collected at 83 stream sites from 2008 to 2012 across the Li River Basin, China. We used random forests to model the variation of individual metrics with natural gradients, then used their residual distributions as the adjusted response range of each metric, independent of natural environmental influence. To select core metrics for MMI, the candidate adjusted and unadjusted metrics were all screened through reproducibility, sensitivity, and redundancy tests. The adjusted MMI were more precise, less biased, and more sensitive than the unadjusted MMI. Although the unadjusted MMI were as responsive as the adjusted MMI, the unadjusted MMI increased risks of inferring type I and type II errors. Minimizing the mean of metric correlations as well as avoiding biological information redundancy improved the performance of unadjusted and adjusted MMI, but only improved precision for the adjusted MMI. Using multi-season and multi-year samples proved to be an effective and efficient assessment method to diminish natural seasonal variation in adjusted MMI, but not unadjusted MMI. We found that the adjusted MMI with the lowest mean of metric correlations using multi-season and multi-year samples performed best and reduced seasonal variability.

AB  - In this work, a sand and dust storm vulnerability mapping (SDS-VM) approach is developed to model the vulnerability of urban blocks to SDS using GIS spatial analysis and a range of geographical data. The SDS-VM was carried out in Ahvaz, IRAN, representing one of the most dust-polluted cities in West Asia. Here, vulnerability is defined as a function of three components: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of the people in the city blocks to sand and dust storms. These components were formulated into measurable indicators (i.e. GIS layers) including: PM2.5, wind speed, distance from dust emission sources, demographic statistics (age, gender, family size, education level), number of building floors, building age, land surface temperature (LST), land use, percentage of literate population, distance from health services, distance from city facilities (city center, shopping centers), distance from infrastructure (public transportation, main roads and highways), distance from parks and green spaces, and green area per capita. The components and the indicators were weighted using analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Different levels of risks for the components and the indicators were defined using ordered weighted averaging (OWA). Urban SDS vulnerability maps at different risk levels were generated through spatial multi-criteria data analysis procedure. Vulnerability maps, with different risk levels, were validated against field-collected data of 781 patients hospitalized for dust-related diseases (i.e. respiratory, cardiovascular, and skin). Results showed that (i) SDS vulnerability map, obtained from the developed methodology, gives an overall accuracy of 79%; (ii); regions 1 and 5 of Ahvaz are recognized with the highest and lowest vulnerabilities to SDS, respectively; and (iii) ORness equal to 0 (very low risk) is the optimum SDS-VM risk level for decision-making to mitigate the harmful impacts of SDS in the deposition areas of Ahvaz city.

AB  - The concept of ecosystem-based management (EBM) emerged from growing concern around adverse environmental impacts associated with resource management in the late twentieth century. Despite inconsistencies and ambiguities in both definition and implementation, the concept has seen considerable uptake in federal and provincial/state policies. More recently, municipal urban forest plans and programs have been making reference to EBM, yet there is almost no existing research on EBM in urban settings. In this paper, we discuss EBM in the context of urban forest ecosystems. Specifically, we ask three questions: (1) how might the concept of EBM remain relevant and be applied in densely-populated urban settings; (2) what structure and form might EBM take in the management of urban forest ecosystems; and (3) what are some examples of EBM applications in municipal urban forestry? The review is structured around 10 prominent themes from the EBM literature, which are re-negotiated for the urban context and, where necessary, are altered, omitted, or replaced with new themes. We also draw from four complementary cases of EBM in practice in Halifax, Toronto, and Edmonton. The resulting 12 themes of urban forest EBM include: Resilience, hierarchical context, social-ecological boundaries, data and information management, monitoring, adaptive management, interagency cooperation, partnerships and civic engagement, organizational change, social change, environmental justice, and values. Urban forests are important ecosystem service providers, but managers face a host of challenges, ranging from a consistent lack of resources to degraded urban sites. Continued dialogue on best approaches for integrating ecological principles into management is essential.

AB  - Based on RS, GIS and Apack software, the indices of landscape pattern such as landscape area index, landscape diversity index and landscape fragmentation index were chosen in order to describe changes in the spatial pattern of alpine wetland landscape on the Zoige Plateau during 1966–2000. Results showed that alpine wetland landscape was characteristic of marsh wetlands, which had the biggest patch number and the largest area. The alpine wetland landscape had higher spatial heterogeneity. The largest area appeared in Zoige County with the highest wetland ratio; comparatively, Aba County and Luqu County had much lower wetland ratio. The total area of alpine wetland landscape decreased rapidly during 1966–1986, but it began to increase after 1986. The wetland landscape area shrank by 59857.83 hm2 during 1966–2000. The alpine wetland landscape showed the characteristics of concentrated distribution in the past four decades, with higher convergence and dominance indices. The centroid of wetland landscape moved 12.54 km in the northwest direction firstly, 11.33 km in the southeast direction, and then 1.1 km in the north direction.

AB  - Landscape dynamics of wetland are critical for understanding coastal ecosystem health and sustainability. The paper characterizes the spatiotemporal dynamics of the wetland landscape in the Zhoushan Islands during 1985–2015 to reveal the spatially explicit influential indicators. Wetland distribution in four periods (1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015) was derived from Landsat Images via artificial visual interpretation and support vector machine. Landscape pattern indices were then used to quantify landscape changes and statistical data was employed to identify the drivers. During 1985–2015, the total area of the Zhoushan Islands had been increased from 1277.15 km2 in 1985 to 1368.12 km2, and the total area of wetlands gradually increased from 123.31 km2 to 195.88 km2. The two-subtype wetlands presented opposite trends: the natural wetland decreased from 68.15 km2 to 62.08 km2 while the artificial wetland increased from 55.16 km2 to 133.80 km2. Since 1995, the area of artificial wetlands has exceeded that of natural wetlands. Moreover, natural wetland gradually became fragmented. The dominant transition of wetland types in the Zhoushan Islands was from natural wetlands to artificial wetlands. Moreover, some other transitions include artificial wetlands transferred to non-wetlands and new reclamation lands from the ocean transferred to construction and aquaculture lands were also identified. The wetland landscape pattern changes were not only affected by natural and socioeconomic factors, but also influenced by urbanization level and reclamation projects. Furthermore, the increasing artificial wetlands also played an important role in protecting the local ecological environment.

Study focus
AOSR pre-disturbance landscape consists of a mosaic of upland-peatland complexes, dominated by fens, which have become the focus of recent mandatory reclamation efforts. Quantifiable metrics for evaluating reclamation project trajectories and long-term sustainability are required. Here, the initial performance of a constructed upland-peatland complex (Nikanotee Fen Watershed) is evaluated through a functional-based, ecosystem-scale approach focused on carbon dynamics and water use efficiency (WUE). Initial seven years (2013–2019) post-construction were monitored using eddy covariance and multispectral imagery to capture ecosystem evolution.
New hydrological insights for the region
Results indicate the fen quickly evolved from a bare-ground, carbon source (2013) to a sedge-dominated (Carex aquatilis), carbon sink (2015). Slower growth rate of trees (Pinus banksiana, Populus balsamifera) and dry edaphic upland conditions initially resulted in net carbon losses. However, as upland vegetation became established, plant CO2 uptake increased. After 2015, fen WUE remained relatively stable despite fluctuations in seasonal rainfall. Stable WUE reflects a well-connected groundwater network between the two landscape units that supports hydrological self-regulation sufficient to maintain adequate plant function. Because of this groundwater supply, fen plants were no longer dependent solely on precipitation – increasing resilience to intervals of periodic water stress. Overall, carbon and water dynamics during early-development suggests the system is evolving towards a self-sustaining, carbon-accumulating, functional ecosystem.

The paper attempts to identify the various highway landscape characters that intrigue the user. Many developments of highways do not consider the existing natural landscape or the existing developed landscape thus resulting in the loss of valuable natural and historical areas. The perception and value one has differs from one another. A review on researches and journals are done in search of theories on highway landscape characters. This study attempts to identify user's preference on the highway landscape characters that are unique and aesthetically pleasing.

AB  - Deforestation captures most of the headlines, but there are also processes of forest expansion that are widespread in Latin America. This paper explores why this process is so invisible. Globalization plays an increasingly important role in structuring rural economies. This paper analyses how global integration of many types, ranging from remittances, state transfers, skilling and markets produced forest recovery in peasant landscapes.

AB  - Aquatic species represent a vast diversity of metazoans, provide humans with the most abundant animal protein source, and are of increasing conservation concern, yet landscape genomics is dominated by research in terrestrial systems. We provide researchers with a roadmap to plan aquatic landscape genomics projects by aggregating spatial and software resources and offering recommendations from sampling to data production and analyses, while cautioning against analytical pitfalls. Given the unique properties of water, we discuss the importance of considering freshwater system structure and marine abiotic properties when assessing genetic diversity, population connectivity, and signals of natural selection. When possible, genomic datasets should be parsed into neutral, adaptive, and sex-linked datasets to generate the most accurate inferences of eco-evolutionary processes.

AB  - Canada is dominated by remote wilderness areas that make important conservation contributions, but are currently only protected de facto by their inaccessibility. Mechanisms for the identification and formal protection of such areas can help ensure that they continue to function naturally and provide essential ecosystem services. However, a lack of spatially explicit, publicly available sources of data on anthropogenic disturbances and natural resource extraction challenges the development of detailed wilderness inventories. We suggest that landscape structure can be used to classify areas of natural landscapes, as trained by the landscape structure of protected areas, and demonstrate this approach by mapping de facto protected areas in Canada’s boreal forest. Overall, between 50%, based on landscape structure, and 80%, based on anthropogenic infrastructure alone, of Canada’s boreal zone exists in large, intact blocks. The true extent of boreal wilderness likely falls within this range, as existing infrastructure datasets may omit disturbance and the protected area network in far northern areas proved inadequate to train effective wilderness classifications. We anticipate that such efforts may be improved by refining the identification of training areas or by classifying along additional landscape metrics. Nevertheless, the areas identified are valuable candidates for protected area expansion, and can contribute to a reserve network that meets national and regional conservation targets and is representative of the range of vegetation productivities, which was used as a biodiversity surrogate. Our general approach need not be limited to the boreal forest, as it has the potential to successfully identify relatively undisturbed (or less disturbed) areas over a range of systems and across levels of human influence.

AB  - The rapid development and ongoing advancement in remote-sensing and geographic information technologies has, and will continue to have a profound effect on the discipline of geomorphology. New remote-sensing platforms and sensor payloads offer new capabilities to obtain geospatial data and characterize various properties and features in the atmosphere, on the land surface, and in the near subsurface. Similar advances are being made in computation, information extraction techniques, numerical modeling and the use of artificial intelligence for assessing landscape patterns and numerical relationships. These advances are necessary to address geospatial data science issues involving the increased dimensionality of geospatial data, formalizing and digitally representing important concepts, and accounting for analysis and modeling complexity. Consequently, geospatial data science research is now commonplace in geomorphological investigations, as we seek to better understand forcing factors, surface processes, geomorphological systems and topographic evolution. Significant advances have occurred in geodesy, remote sensing, photogrammetry, geophysics, computer science, statistics, pattern recognition, and other STEM disciplines. Consequently, we have many new capabilities to better investigate climate forcing, quantify surface biophysical properties, characterize the topography, map landforms, link process and form/patterns, and improve our understanding of scale dependencies and the polygenetic nature of landscape evolution. Numerous issues, however, still need to be addressed that involve the synthesis of geomorphological and geospatial data science concepts that can be addressed using advanced cyberGIS capabilities. The mere availability of new spatio-temporal data and software tools does not equate to accurate information production and new understandings in geomorphology. Consequently, this chapter introduces rapidly developing capabilities and new developments in geospatial data science that are relevant to various types of geomorphological investigations. The emphasis is on using data and analysis/modeling approaches to better understand landforms and geomorphological systems. This treatment represents an introduction and overview of literature, and highlights the many uses of such advances in geomorphology.

AB  - Village landscapes, which integrate small-scale agriculture with housing, forestry, and a host of other land use practices, cover more than 2 million square kilometers across China. Village lands tend to be managed at very fine spatial scales (≤ 30 m), with managers both adapting their practices to existing variation in soils and terrain (e.g., fertile plains vs. infertile slopes) and also altering soil fertility and even terrain by terracing, irrigation, fertilizing, and other land use practices. Relationships between fine-scale land management patterns and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the top 30 cm of village soils were studied by sampling soils within fine-scale landscape features using a regionally weighted landscape sampling design across five environmentally distinct sites in China. SOC stocks across China's village regions (5 Pg C in the top 30 cm of 2 × 106 km2) represent roughly 4% of the total SOC stocks in global croplands. Although macroclimate varied from temperate to tropical in this study, SOC density did not vary significantly with climate, though it was negatively correlated with regional mean elevation. The highest SOC densities within landscapes were found in agricultural lands, especially paddy, the lowest SOC densities were found in nonproductive lands, and forest lands tended toward moderate SOC densities. Due to the high SOC densities of agricultural lands and their predominance in village landscapes, most village SOC was found in agricultural land, except in the tropical hilly region, where forestry accounted for about 45% of the SOC stocks. A surprisingly large portion of village SOC was associated with built structures and with the disturbed lands surrounding these structures, ranging from > 18% in the North China Plain to about 9% in the tropical hilly region. These results confirmed that local land use practices, combined with local and regional variation in terrain, were associated with most of the SOC variation within and across China's village landscapes and may be an important cause of regional variation in SOC.

AB  - Studying the earth's climatic and environmental system requires precise land cover (LC) information, particularly over forested areas to accurately account for the carbon budget. This study's objective was to evaluate the accuracy of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LC product (MCD12Q1) over a forested area covering Northern Iran. We applied fuzzy sets theory and quantified the magnitude, source, and nature of the errors in the MODIS landcover product. Compared to the traditional classical set theory, the fuzzy set theory was found to be more compatible with the continuum nature of land surface features, thus more suitable for LC identification and evaluation. Our accuracy assessment of MCD12Q1 products showed specific patterns of uncertainty and inconsistency when the product was compared against the finer resolution platforms (i.e., Landsat, Google Earth, and local observation). The overall accuracy of MODIS landcover was estimated at 68.3% considering all MCD12Q1 landcover classes and 89% considering the forest category. More specifically, the “dense forest” class was identified as the most accurate (~95% accuracy), whereas the “open forest” class was the least accurate (45% accuracy), and the “forest/cropland” class was the most challenging to analyze. The “natural herbaceous” class was repeatedly misidentified with the “herbaceous cropland” and “open forest” categories leading to the largest uncertainty compared to other LC classes (confusion value = 53). The applied method that is used in this study was most useful to illustrate the degree of accuracy of MODIS product with actual LC types. For the heterogeneous grid cell where several landcover types were present, the MODIS could not accurately detect the LC type, and high error, confusion, and ambiguity have resulted. This signified the inefficiency of MODIS's spatial resolution for LC assessment in sensitive applications (e.g., LC change detection).

Study focus
Knowledge of the mean recharge elevation (MRE) of water resources is important where water resources are vulnerable. The purpose of this study was to develop and apply a Bayesian approach which incorporates isotopic uncertainties and evaporative effects on isotopic compositions to determine the MRE of 680 surface water sources from Central America. Differences were assessed between results from our approach and those from other isotope-based methods that do not account for these factors.
New hydrological insights for the region
Different MRE patterns were identified for Pacific and Caribbean basins, which were characterized by distinct isotopic signatures: 1) the Pacific slope had recharge occurring at higher elevations relative to the source mean catchment elevation (MCE) and 2) the Caribbean slope had recharge largely occurring at elevations lower than the MCE. These relationships were quantified: MREP = 1.072 (MCE) + 45.65 (Pacific: r2 = 0.93, error = 144 m); MREC = 0.9493 (MCE) – 28.24 (Caribbean: r2 = 0.83, error = 190 m). The MRE, surface water site elevation (SWSE), and MRE-SWSE differences were generally greater on the Pacific slope, which hosts most of the region’s population. Bayesian MRE estimates were on average lower than MREs obtained using other methods and may better approximate the actual (recharge-weighed) MRE, suggesting that the inclusion of isotopic uncertainties, evaporative corrections, and recharge likelihoods all positively effect MRE estimations.

AB  - Describing current, past and future landscapes for inventory and policy making purposes requires classifications capturing variation in, for example, land use and land cover. Typical land cover classifications for such purposes result from a top-down process and rely on expert conceptualisations, and thus provide limited space for incorporating more widely held views of key landscape elements. In this paper we introduce the notion of spatial folksonomies, which we define as a tuple linking a vocabulary of landscape terms through authors and resources to locations. We demonstrate how spatial folksonomies can automatically be created for Switzerland using two text corpora: the Swiss Alpine Club's yearbook for the past 150 years and user generated content from a website describing a wide range of outdoor activities. The spatial folksonomies capture variation in space of the use of nouns describing 96 natural landscape terms (e.g. ridge, forest, mountain, etc.) and allow us to characterise regions and compute similarities. We compare our spatial folksonomies to two traditional land cover/land use classifications (CORINE and Arealstatistik) and demonstrate that despite their very different sources, the approaches capture landscape variation in broadly similar ways. However, our spatial folksonomies provide new insights into how landscapes are described, through for example variation in space, time and through the prism of different activities. We argue that our spatial folksonomies are a novel way of capturing variation closer to the bottom-up understandings of landscape for instance required to describe cultural ecosystem services.

AB  - Soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling have been important drivers in the advancement of our understanding of soil from the earliest days of the scientific study of soils. Soil maps were desirable for purposes of land valuation for taxation, agronomic planning, and even in military operations. Soil mapping required classification systems that would allow communication of mapped information, classification systems required understanding of the soil system, and gaining that understanding included the creation of soil models. Therefore, advancement in one of these highly interrelated areas tended to lead to corresponding advances in the others, and these relationships persist into the modern era. Although many advances in our understanding of the soil system have been made since the late 1800s, when soil science blossomed into a scientific discipline in its own right, there are still many unanswered questions and additional needs in soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling. New technologies including GPS, GIS, remote sensing, on-site geophysical instrumentation (EMI, GPR, PXRF, etc.), and the development of statistical and geostatistical techniques have greatly increased our ability to collect, analyze, and predict spatial information related to soils, but linking all of this new information to soil properties and processes can still be a challenge and enhanced pedologic models are needed. The expansion of the use of soil knowledge to address issues beyond agronomic production, such as land use planning, environmental concerns, food security, energy security, water security, and human health, to name a few, requires new ways to communicate what we know about the soils we map as well as bringing forth research questions that were not widely considered in earlier soils studies. At present this information is communicated using dozens of national soil classification systems as well as WRB, but a more universal soil classification system would facilitate international communication of soils information. There are still many significant needs in the area of soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling going into the future.

AB  - Detailed soil and surficial geologic data are needed for ecological interpretations, yet are often absent or incomplete in published studies of arid land ecology or biogeography. Clear, edaphic habitat definitions are needed for gypsophilic plants including the Las Vegas buckwheat, E. corymbosum var. nilesii (LVB), a rare shrub endemic to the Mojave Desert. As a case study, we use soil profile data and high resolution (1:3000 scale) surficial geologic maps to identify likely edaphic controls of LVB habitat, potential habitat, and non-habitat distributions. We confirm gypsiferous substrates lacking hard, physical surface crusts as a boundary condition in most, but not all population clusters, but find that fine-grained, carbonate-rich soil lacking gypsum is also viable habitat, as is shallow (<1m) sandy alluvium overlying gypsiferous sediments. Deep (>1m), coarse-grained alluvium and/or surfaces with tightly interlocking desert pavement exclude LVB. Our results challenge the view of this target species as a true gypsophile, however, it remains unclear whether carbonate-rich habitats represent ideal conditions or refugia. This study underscores the important merits of surficial geologic mapping and soil morphological description for ecological research, conservation, restoration, and land management in arid environments, especially gypsum soils, worldwide.

AB  - This research provides a method for modelling landscape experience that combines space, time, and landscape character. The visual landscape experience is particularly challenging to model because it involves perception that is specific to an individual, views that vary in extent, a period of time that the experience takes place, and a complex interaction of landform and land-cover, including cultural elements. Landscape experience is important to the quality of people's lives and is a substantial component of the tourism industry. To represent such experiences there is a need to develop techniques to model landscape experience. The method demonstrated is based on the landscape experience while walking a track and combines GIS viewshed analysis with a GIS generated landscape character classification. This method takes into account near and distant landscape views and weights the area that each landscape type is viewed by the length of time that it is viewed. The results produce a new metric that combines space and time and has the units of hectare-hours. This paper argues that there is a need for a unit that combines space and time so that landscape experience can be measured, compared and researched. It is proposed that this unit be called “experions” and this paper shows how such a unit can be measured using GIS. This metric measures landscape character experience rather than quality, but can be converted to quality when combined with landscape preference information.

AB  - Iqaluit International Airport presently suffers from instabilities and subsidence along its runway, taxiways and apron. In particular, asphalt surfaces are significantly impacted by settlement and cracking. These instabilities may be related to permafrost, permafrost degradation and associated drainage conditions. Low induction number electromagnetic measurements along with galvanic and capacitive electrical resistivity surveys were performed over selected areas within the airport boundary and in the near vicinity to assist with permafrost characterization and to investigate active permafrost processes. Electrical resistivity images suggest distinct electrical signatures for different terrain units and sediment types, and for ice-rich material including ice wedges. Anomalous regions are identified that are coincident with localized settlement problems. Repeated resistivity maps reveal seasonal changes indicative of high unfrozen water content and freeze/thaw of groundwater beneath airport infrastructure in distinct regions related to surficial geology. Even with continuous permafrost and cold permafrost temperatures, the resistivity models reveal anomalously conductive material at depth that is not obviously correlated to mapped surficial sediments and that may represent thaw susceptible sediments or significant unfrozen water content.

AB  - Here we evaluate the hypothesis that during cold climatic phases, people and resources became increasingly packed along highland Lesotho's riverine corridors as the viability of palatable grasslands for large mammal hunting on the upland plateaus declined. These intensification efforts resulted in increased reliance on lower-ranked aquatic (fish) resources with knock-on effects for lithic technological organization. We compare data on the relative contribution of fishing to the diets of highland hunter-gatherers at Sehonghong rockshelter with a faunal proxy widely argued to correlate with subsistence intensification (faunal assemblage evenness). In addition, we compare these data with two measures of lithic technological intensification (cutting edge production and core reduction intensity) to test whether diet intensification tracks technological intensification. We show that at Sehonghong, aquatic resource exploitation is not always correlated with faunal assemblage evenness. We find that some layers (i.e. RF) show spikes in aquatic resource use irrespective of changes in faunal assemblage evenness. Other layers (i.e. RBL/CLBRF) were intensively occupied, but they do not have many fish. Our data also demonstrate that aquatic resource use is not correlated with lithic technological intensification. These results suggest that while aquatic resource exploitation was a ‘fallback’ option for some of Lesotho's highland hunter-gatherers, there is considerable variability. Our data show that multiple intensification dimensions were variably combined through the Late Pleistocene at Sehonghong as they were elsewhere in southern Africa.

AB  - Urban forests are now recognized as essential components of sustainable cities, but there remains uncertainty concerning how to stratify and classify urban landscapes into units of ecological significance at spatial scales appropriate for management. Ecosystem classification is an approach that entails quantifying the social and ecological processes that shape ecosystem conditions into logical and relatively homogeneous management units, making the potential for ecosystem-based decision support available to urban planners. The purpose of this study is to develop and propose a framework for urban forest ecosystem classification (UFEC). The multifactor framework integrates 12 ecosystem components that characterize the biophysical landscape, built environment, and human population. This framework is then applied at the neighbourhood scale in Toronto, Canada, using hierarchical cluster analysis. The analysis used 27 spatially-explicit variables to quantify the ecosystem components in Toronto. Twelve ecosystem classes were identified in this UFEC application. Across the ecosystem classes, tree canopy cover was positively related to economic wealth, especially income. However, education levels and homeownership were occasionally inconsistent with the expected positive relationship with canopy cover. Open green space and stocking had variable relationships with economic wealth and were more closely related to population density, building intensity, and land use. The UFEC can provide ecosystem-based information for greening initiatives, tree planting, and the maintenance of the existing canopy. Moreover, its use has the potential to inform the prioritization of limited municipal resources according to ecological conditions and to concerns of social equity in the access to nature and distribution of ecosystem service supply.

AB  - A new approach to the classification of estuaries is described. The estuary environment classification (EEC) is based on a hierarchical view of the abiotic components that comprise the environments of estuaries. The EEC postulates that climate, oceanic, riverine and catchment factors ‘control’ a hierarchy of processes and broadly determine the physical and biological characteristics of estuaries. The classification differentiates estuaries at four levels of detail. Level 1 differentiates global scale variation based on differences in climatic and oceanic processes, which are discriminated by the factors: latitude, oceanic basins and large landmasses. Level 2 differentiates variation in estuary hydrodynamic processes, which are discriminated by estuary basin morphometry, river and oceanic forcing. Level 3 differentiates variation among estuaries that are due to catchment processes, which are discriminated by catchment geology and catchment land cover. The approach has been applied to all the estuaries in New Zealand using existing data sources. Estuaries were assigned class membership at each level of the classification by applying criteria in the form of decision rules to the database of assignment characteristics. GIS was then used to map the estuaries with classes being defined by colour at any level of the classification. The resulting map provides a multi-scale spatial framework that is suitable for many environmental or conservation management applications.

AB  - Evaluation from landscape pattern change can comprehensively reflect the impact of ecological policies on the ecosystem service function. However, previous assessments based on landscape patterns only considered land cover type and ignored the quality of vegetation cover, which could hardly reflect regional differences in restoration durability and sustainability. Based on the temporal phase characteristics of the vegetation index, this study proposes the concept of Persistent Green Patches (PGPs). Taking Yan'an, a key area for the implementation of ecological projects in the Loess Plateau, as a study area, the effect of ecological policies was evaluated from the pattern change of PGPs from 2000 to 2017 through Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA). It is found that (1) the area of PGPs was increased from 14.45% to 44.26% in Yan'an since the implementation of the ecological projects; (2) the Grain for Green projects can hardly form a short-term increase of PGPs; while the Natural Forest Protection projects can quickly increase the PGPs area, its effect would tend to be saturated or even decrease in the long term; (3) the fragmentation and connectivity of the landscape show that the ecological projects promote the connection between different green patches, and improves the overall connectivity of the PGPs. This study provides a new perspective on evaluating the effect of ecological projects, which is expected to provide a reference for the future optimization of relevant ecological policies and regional sustainable development.

AB  - Agricultural expansion and intensification threaten pollinator populations worldwide, potentially jeopardizing crop pollination. Although the highest rates of cropland expansion are currently found within the tropics, quantifying effects of landscape composition on tropical pollinator communities and the provided pollination services to crops has received relatively limited attention. Here, we studied the relationship between land use in the landscape matrix surrounding Ethiopian coffee production forests and their bee communities and coffee pollination services. We used pan traps to collect bees from 20 plots located in small-scale coffee (Coffea arabica) production forests of varying size in a major Arabica coffee production zone in southwestern Ethiopia. To estimate the provided coffee pollination services, we performed pollinator exclusion experiments and calculated yield stability across three years. We collected 595 bees belonging to 27 species, with the honeybee (Apis mellifera) as dominant species. We found a significant convex parabolic relationship between the non-Apis bee diversity within coffee production forests and the proportion of open agricultural land in the surrounding landscape. Pollinator exclusion resulted in a significantly lower initial, but not final, fruit set. Whereas initial fruit set was not affected by the composition of the bee community, our results indicated a positive relation between non-Apis bee diversity and temporal coffee yield stability. High proportions of fruit drop suggested that physiological stress factors may have abrogated the potential benefits of insect pollination in the final fruit set. We conclude that the agricultural land and homesteads surrounding the coffee production forests still support sufficient nesting and feeding resources for non-Apis bees, hence providing a source of potential coffee pollinators. Increasing human population in the region and the increasing demand for food may present future challenges to reconcile the required increased agricultural production with the conservation of pollinator species and pollination services.

AB  - Distributed hydrological models are valuable tools that can be used to support water management in catchments. However, the complexity of management issues, the variety of modelling objectives, and the variable availability of data require a flexible way to customize models and adapt them to each individual problem. Environmental modelling frameworks offer such flexibility; they are designed to build and run integrated models on the basis of reusable and exchangeable components. This paper presents the LIQUID® framework, developed by Hydrowide since 2005. The purpose of developing LIQUID® was to provide both easier integration of hydrological processes and preservation of their characteristic temporal and spatial scales. It suits a wide range of applications, both in terms of spatial scales and of process conceptualisations. LIQUID® is able to synchronize different time steps, to handle irregular geometries, and to simulate complex connections between components, in particular involving feedback. The paper presents the concepts of LIQUID® and the technical choices made to meet the above requirements, with focuses on the simulation run system and on the spatial discretization of process components. The use of the framework is illustrated by five application cases associated with contrasted spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Accessing the impact of land use/land cover dynamics on the Ecosystem Service Values (ESVs) is necessary for sustainable development at regional and global scale. Estimation of changes in Ecosystem service value (ESV) in response to local climatic zones (LCZs) are performed using GIS technique and corresponding with the global value coefficient for the year 2000 and 2017 in SSPA. Coefficient of Sensitivity (CS) is also used to access the reliability of the estimation process for using the LCZ classes as a proxy with the equivalent biomes. During the study period, the compact low rise (LCZ 3), open low rise (LCZ 6), bare soil/sand (LCZ F2) increased by 22.35%, 23.76% and 0.35% per year. On the other hand cropland (LCZ F1), water (LCZ G) and sparsely built (LCZ 9) decreased by 1.36%, 1.62% and 1.78% per year respectively. The overall result also shows a decreasing trend of total ESV since 2000–2017 from US$ 1 million and US$ 3.5 million when value coefficient of 1997 and modified value coefficient of 2014 is applied. The significant changes are also recorded in individual ecosystem service function such as water regulation, water supply, soil formation, nutrient cycling, food production, genetic resource which are the highest contributor to total ESVs for both the unit values used.

AB  - Coastal systems are inherently variable alongshore, particularly sandy-beach systems along barrier coasts. Variability in the beach and dune influences the response and recovery of coastal barriers to storm activity, which in turn influences the evolution of these systems with rising sea levels and a change in storm activity. Characterizing this variability provides important insights on how the system has evolved over a wide range of timescales, and it can be used to predict how the system may evolve in the future. This article reviews scale-dependent topographic variations in sandy beach environments, and the field and spatial analytical methods used to characterize alongshore variability in beach and dune morphology, over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, in response to both free (self-reinforcing) storm and anthropogenic perturbations and forced by a framework geology. Across all spatiotemporal scales, the alongshore variability in beach and dune morphology influences the response and recovery of barrier islands to storm activity, and thereby provides important insights about the evolution of that system. This article examines the various analytical approaches used to characterize the alongshore variability of barrier environments, the methods used to extract coastal morphology from digital elevation models, the opportunities for multi-sensor integration and how machine learning provides an opportunity to characterize this variability and identify scale-dependent controls.

AB  - Freshwater sensitivity to acidification varies according to geology, soils and land-use, and consequently it remains difficult to quantify the current extent of acidification, or its biological impacts, based on limited spot samples. The problem is particularly acute for river systems, where the transition from acid to circum-neutral conditions can occur within short distances. This paper links an established point-based long-term acidification model (MAGIC) with a landscape-based mixing model (PEARLS) to simulate spatial and temporal variations in acidification for a 256 km2 catchment in North Wales. Empirical relationships are used to predict changes in the probability of occurrence of an indicator invertebrate species, Baetis rhodani, across the catchment as a function of changing chemical status. Results suggest that, at present, 27% of the river network has a mean acid neutralising capacity (ANC) below a biologically-relevant threshold of 20 μeq l−1. At high flows, this proportion increases to 45%. The model suggests that only around 16% of the stream network had a mean ANC < 20 μeq l−1 in 1850, but that this increased to 42% at the sulphur deposition peak around 1970. By 2050 recovery is predicted, but with some persistence of acid conditions in the most sensitive, peaty headwaters. Stream chemical suitability for Baetis rhodani is also expected to increase in formerly acidified areas, but for overall abundance to remain below that simulated in 1850. The approach of linking plot-scale process-based models to catchment mixing models provides a potential means of predicting the past and future spatial extent of acidification within large, heterogeneous river networks and regions. Further development of ecological response models to include other chemical predictor variables and the effects of acid episodes would allow more realistic simulation of the temporal and spatial dynamics of ecosystem recovery from acidification.

AB  - The decisions of the central Chinese government have been a key driver of the urbanization process in large cities in eastern China, however their influence on the later-urbanizing cities in central China is unclear. The objective of this study was to use remote sensing data and spatial metrics to identify the relative influence of planning policies at various levels (relative to socioeconomic influences) on trends in landscape patterns in the rapid urbanization process of Zhengzhou, the capital city of Henan Province and the core city of central China. Our results revealed that Zhengzhou's rapid urbanization process started about a decade after the eastern coastal cities due to the national development strategy (the Preferential Regional Development Strategy in 1980s and the Hinterland City Opening Policy in 1992), but boomed after 2000 due to increasing national support along with an increased number of planning policies at multiple levels. After 2004, the city experienced a critical landscape transition from a primarily agricultural to an urban-dominated landscape (which has not yet occurred over the whole region). Planning for an inter-city railway network and construction between cities increased the connectivity of urban space, but fragmented other land use types. Urban and green space expanded primarily into agricultural areas, reducing them in extent, simplifying their boundaries, and increasing their fragmentation; these changes likely reduce food production capacity. Trends in construction sites illustrate the exhaustion of land resources in Zhengzhou city and forecast a new round of urban growth in the adjacent cities (Xinzheng, Zhongmou and Xingyang). High-level policy intervention and scientific planning will be very important to urban-rural sustainable development for the region.

AB  - The urban thermal environment is one of the most important effects of urban landscape changes and significantly influences human health. For selecting dominant indicators and presenting the spatial variability of the causative factors of the urban thermal environment, a new modeling framework was constructed by structural equation model (SEM) and factor analysis. A highly urbanized city in China, Shenzhen, was chosen as a case area. We built different SEM models to select an appropriate model to describe the relationship between landscape indicators and surface temperature. The landscape character was described from landscape composition, spatial intensity of human activities, and spatial configuration aspects, including biophysical parameters, population density, energy-consumption, and landscape metrics based on remote-sensing and census data. Results demonstrated a structural correlation between landscape composition, spatial configuration and surface temperature, and showed that landscape composition contributed more than spatial configuration to surface temperature. The correlation coefficients between surface temperature and landscape composition were −0.59, −0.52 and −0.47 in the year of 2005, 2010 and 2016. The contribution of spatial configuration to surface temperature was very low for the entire urban scale. Five dominant landscape indicators (impervious surface area, normalized difference vegetation index, patch density, largest patch index and aggregation index) were selected to describe landscape composition and spatial configuration. Factor analysis showed significant spatial variability in the relationship between landscape indicators and surface temperature. The areas with more significant response to spatial configuration has been increasing from 2005 to 2016 and been gathered in the manufacturing industrial regions and the edge of mountain areas, where temperature can be regulated effectively by spatial configuration optimization. The findings will enhance the understanding of urban thermal environment and provide a methodological framework for studying the spatial variability of the relationship between landscape indicators and functions.

AB  - Soil erosion is often regarded as one of the main processes of desertification. This has led to the use of various desertification indicators that are related to soil erosion. Most of these indicators focus, however, on small spatial units, while little attention has been given to the amount of sediment exported at the catchment scale. Such a small spatial unit approach neglects the transfer of sediment through catchments as well as the scale-dependency of erosion processes. Furthermore, this approach does not consider important off-site impacts of soil erosion, such as sediment deposition in reservoirs, flooding as well as ecological impacts. This study aims to illustrate the importance of also considering catchment sediment yield (SY, tkm−2y−1) in desertification assessment studies. Based on recently established databases of SY and soil loss rates in Europe and examples from previous studies, we illustrate that soil erosion rates at the plot scale are not representative for catchment SY, as they are often several orders of magnitude smaller. Also, the erosion response of catchments to changes in land use or climate often differs strongly from responses to those changes at the plot scale. We further discuss several of the impacts of SY and their link with desertification: i.e. the sedimentation of reservoirs, problems related to flooding, catchment hydrology, export of nutrients and ecological implications. Using earlier established criteria we evaluate the potential for using catchment SY as a desertification indicator and conclude that this could give an important added value to desertification studies. SY, used in combination with other indicators, allows the identification of other sediment sources than those considered at the plot scale and can reflect the results of desertification processes over longer time periods than periods over which assessments at the plot scale have been made. We argue therefore, that SY is a strong complementary indicator of desertification providing valuable information on the catchment response to changes in drivers of desertification.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to recommend a rapid conceptual classification model for Sustainable Flood Retention Basins (SFRB) used to control runoff in a temperate climate. An SFRB is an aesthetically pleasing retention basin predominantly used for flood protection adhering to sustainable drainage and best management practices. The classification model was developed on the basis of a database of 141 SFRB using the River Rhine catchment in Baden (part of Baden-Württemberg, Germany) as a case study. It is based on an agglomerative cluster analysis and is intended to be used by engineers and scientists to adequately classify the following different types of SFRB: Hydraulic Flood Retention Basin, Traditional Flood Retention Basin, Sustainable Flood Retention Wetland, Aesthetic Flood Retention Wetland, Integrated Flood Retention Wetland and Natural Flood Retention Wetland. The selection of classification variables was supported by a principal component analysis. The identification of SFRB in the data set was based on a Ward cluster analysis of 34 weighted classification variables. Scoring tables were defined to enable the assignment of the six SFRB definitions to retention basins in the data set. The efficiency of these tables was based on a scoring system which gave the conceptual model for the example case study sites an overall efficiency of approximately 60% (as opposed to 17% by chance). This conceptual classification model should be utilized to improve communication by providing definitions for SFRB types. The classification definitions are likely to be applicable for other regions with both temperate oceanic and temperate continental climates.

AB  - The application of landscape ecology in conservation biology has rarely occurred in the context of defined landscapes. Conservation planning has focussed on representation of species diversity patterns and assumed that ecosystems, landscapes and their associated processes will be equally protected. The long-term persistence of biodiversity in the face of land transformations and global change requires the representation and retention of all elements of biodiversity. This biodiversity includes landscapes, and the landscape structure and processes that maintain patterns of biodiversity. We developed a method of classifying landscapes for the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. The process entailed the use of 1km2 grid data from climate and terrain databases. Principal components analysis coupled with a cluster classification method and spatial overlay techniques were used to identify two hierarchical levels of landscapes. Validation analysis showed that landscapes are identifiable with a classification accuracy of 86.8%. The derived landscapes can be combined separately with data on vegetation and soil to describe landscape ecosystems that potentially differ in species composition, successional dynamics, and potential productivity. The surrogate use of the landscapes in conjunction with other strategic data, for the identification of priority conservation areas, is demonstrated.

AB  - The incidence of wind erosion and its affect on soil organic carbon content was assessed in a dryland farming system near Jerramungup, Western Australia, using remote sensing, ground observations and soil analysis. Relationships were found between the patterns of wind erosion, past geomorphic processes and an array of soil attributes. These associations can be used to identify those soils that are most susceptible to erosion and thus soil carbon loss. Despite strong evidence of relict aeolian activity associated with a previous more arid climate, the incidence of contemporary wind erosion was only partly related to past geomorphological processes. Quartzose dune sands were particularly susceptible to erosion (47% of total area eroded), whereas texture contrast soils formed on clayey, wind-formed lunettes (16%) and deeply weathered regolith were less eroded (34%). Soils formed on stripped regolith and on loamy surfaced lunettes and swales were not eroded. Wind erosion was strongly related to soil particle size distribution and surface horizon depth, only occurring on sandy surfaced soils, with <5% clay and <3% silt and >50cm deep. The incidence of erosion markedly increased with small decreases in clay and silt contents below these thresholds. Wind erosion resulted in the loss of ∼3% of the total stock of carbon to 1m depth or 3.6tCha−1 for the eroded soils. The consideration of wind erosion induced carbon loss, both from the standpoint of sustaining farmland productivity and also in producing accurate national carbon accounts, at both the project and national scales, requires resolution.

AB  - After independence, Zimbabwe adopted two major land reform programmes to address the racially skewed land ownership. Due to the perceived failure of these programmes, the country embarked on a highly politicised and forceful acquisition and re-distribution of white owned commercial farms under the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP). Whereas a large number of Zimbabweans have been allocated land under the programme, there has been a significant decline in agricultural productivity and an increase in degradation of land and associated resources. Popular opinion has even suggested the country’s current socio-economic challenges are linked to the programme. Mitigating land degradation, enhancing agricultural productivity and promoting natural resources sustainability requires an objective understanding and determination landscape transformation within relevant administrative decision making spatial extents. In this study, we adopted multi-temporal remotely sensed imagery to determine landscape transformation after the implementation of the FTLRP in Chipinge administrative district, characterised by heterogeneous land usage and natural resources. Major land-use-land-cover types were determined using the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm and accuracy established using field survey and ancillary data. Results show significant landscape transformation after the implementation of the FTLRP. Specifically, there was a decline in plantations, small farms, water bodies and forests and an increase in bare areas and settlements. This study demonstrates the value of remotely data in monitoring landscape transformation arising from a shift in policy. Furthermore, these results provide an insight into multi-temporal spatial changes in cultivated, natural and degraded lands, valuable for designing measures to improve landscape productivity and to adopt relevant rehabilitation measures. Understanding multi-temporal landscape change within an administrative boundary is particularly valuable for area specific planning, policy formulation and adoption of desired mitigation measures.

AB  - Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is used to estimate tree, stand, and forest characteristics across large geographic areas. In the province of Nova Scotia, an enhanced forest inventory (EFI) was developed to provide high-resolution spatial forest inventory estimates across the landscape. For various forest attributes, independent LiDAR-based relationships were built leading to mathematical and biological inconsistency among forest attribute estimates. A systems approach, composed of allometric equations describing the relationships between volume per unit area, Lorey’s average height, basal area, quadratic mean diameter, and density, is developed to address these inconsistencies. Previous results showed that applying the systems approach provided reasonable and compatible estimates and eliminated inconsistency issues among forest attributes. This study evaluates application of the systems approach applied to eastern Nova Scotia using field data from a network of permanent sample plots and recent LiDAR acquisitions. The independent EFI estimates had inconsistencies of greater than 100% for basal area and implied stand-level form factor. These inconsistencies were eliminated using the systems approach. Results show that the systems approach can be scaled to larger landscape areas and that long-term field data can be leveraged to fit the allometric systems producing mathematically and biologically consistent estimates.
Le balayage laser aéroporté (BLA) est utilisé pour estimer les caractéristiques des arbres, des peuplements et des forêts sur de grandes étendues géographiques. Dans la province de la Nouvelle-Écosse, un inventaire forestier amélioré (IFA) a été élaboré dans le but de fournir des estimations d’inventaire forestier à haute résolution spatiale pour l’ensemble du paysage. Des relations indépendantes basées sur le BLA ont été construites pour divers attributs forestiers, ce qui a conduit à des incohérences mathématiques et biologiques entre les estimations des attributs forestiers. Une approche systémique, composée d’équations allométriques décrivant les relations entre le volume par unité de surface, la hauteur moyenne de Lorey, la surface terrière, le diamètre moyen quadratique et la densité, est développée pour remédier à ces incohérences. Des résultats précédents ont montré que l’application de l’approche systémique fournissait des estimations raisonnables et compatibles et éliminait les problèmes d’incohérence entre les attributs forestiers. Cette étude évalue l’application de l’approche systémique dans l’est de la Nouvelle-Écosse, à l’aide de données de terrain provenant d’un réseau de placettes-échantillons permanentes et d’acquisitions récentes par BLA. Les estimations indépendantes de l’IFA présentaient des incohérences supérieures à 100 % pour la surface terrière et nécessitaient l’usage d’un facteur de forme à l’échelle du peuplement. Ces incohérences ont été éliminées par l’approche systémique. Les résultats montrent que l’approche systémique peut être adaptée à de plus grandes étendues de paysage et que les données de terrain à long terme peuvent être mises à profit pour étalonner des systèmes allométriques qui produisent des estimations mathématiquement et biologiquement cohérentes.

AB  - In the Neotropics, Rove Beetles (Staphylinidae) are known to be especially diverse and abundant, but studies in this region are still incipient and the information is dispersed in the scientific literature. In this work the responses of the Rove Beetles to gradients of disturbance in representative ecosystems of the Brazilian Amazon were evaluated. Specifically, we assessed the possibility of using patterns in richness, abundance and taxonomic diversity of Rove Beetles as anthropogenic disturbance indicators. The obtained results show that the Rove Beetles richness was sensitive to the structural changes induced by increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Additionally an increasing trend in community complexity from more to less disturbed ecosystems was observed. Differences in responses can be explained by differences in the intensity and extent of the change from pristine systems. Overall, the composition of Rove Beetles communities is ecosystems’ specific and sensitive to anthropogenic induced structural changes and management actions and, therefore, should be considered a valuable ecological indicator for assessing the extent ecosystems’ disruption in the Neotropics.

AB  - In Europe and North America the prevailing model of “natural” lowland streams is incised-meandering channels with silt-clay floodplains, and this is the typical template for stream restoration. Using both published and new unpublished geological and historical data from Europe we critically review this model, show how it is inappropriate for the European context, and examine the implications for carbon sequestration and Riverine Ecosystem Services (RES) including river rewilding. This paper brings together for the first time, all the pertinent strands of evidence we now have on the long-term trajectories of floodplain system from sediment-based dating to sedaDNA. Floodplain chronostratigraphy shows that early Holocene streams were predominantly multi-channel (anabranching) systems, often choked with vegetation and relatively rarely single-channel actively meandering systems. Floodplains were either non-existent or limited to adjacent organic-filled palaeochannels, spring/valley mires and flushes. This applied to many, if not most, small to medium rivers but also major sections of the larger rivers such as the Thames, Seine, Rhône, Lower Rhine, Vistula and Danube. As shown by radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating during the mid-late Holocene c. 4–2 ka BP, overbank silt-clay deposition transformed European floodplains, covering former wetlands and silting-up secondary channels. This was followed by direct intervention in the Medieval period incorporating weir and mill-based systems – part of a deep engagement with rivers and floodplains which is even reflected in river and floodplain settlement place names. The final transformation was the “industrialisation of channels” through hard-engineering – part of the Anthropocene great acceleration. The primary causative factor in transforming pristine floodplains was accelerated soil erosion caused by deforestation and arable farming, but with effective sediment delivery also reflecting climatic fluctuations. Later floodplain modifications built on these transformed floodplain topographies. So, unlike North America where channel-floodplain transformation was rapid, the transformation of European streams occurred over a much longer time-period with considerable spatial diversity regarding timing and kind of modification. This has had implications for the evolution of RES including reduced carbon sequestration over the past millennia. Due to the multi-faceted combination of catchment controls, ecological change and cultural legacy, it is impractical, if not impossible, to identify an originally natural condition and thus restore European rivers to their pre-transformation state (naturalisation). Nevertheless, attempts to restore to historical (pre-industrial) states allowing for natural floodplain processes can have both ecological and carbon offset benefits, as well as additional abiotic benefits such as flood attenuation and water quality improvements. This includes rewilding using beaver reintroduction which has overall positive benefits on river corridor ecology. New developments, particularly biomolecular methods offer the potential of unifying modern ecological monitoring with the reconstruction of past ecosystems and their trajectories. The sustainable restoration of rivers and floodplains designed to maximise desirable RES and natural capital must be predicated on the awareness that Anthropocene rivers are still largely imprisoned in the banks of their history and this requires acceptance of an increased complexity for the achievement and maintenance of desirable restoration goals.

AB  - Farms can harbor substantial biodiversity, which in turn sustains the supply of ecosystem services. The effectiveness of farm management to enhance biodiversity, however, may be modified by land cover in the surrounding landscape beyond a farmer’s direct control. We examined how landscape pattern and farm management affect the abundance and diversity of native bees visiting highbush blueberry in Vermont, USA. We quantified landscape pattern at multiple scales and created an agricultural intensity index that represents farm management practices such as pesticide use, mowed and grain crop area. We observed native bee visitation to assess the supply of pollination service provided to blueberry growers. Across 15 farms, 84 wild bee species were observed visiting highbush blueberry, almost a third of bee species recorded in Vermont. Visitation rate, abundance and species richness increased with the amount of natural area surrounding farms. Less intensively managed farms had higher levels of bee visitation, abundance and a more diverse bee community. Bee communities and the pollination services they provide are influenced by interactions between local management and landscape pattern. In particular, intensive farm management appears to compound the negative effects of landscape simplification. To support native pollinators on their farms, growers should consider farming approaches in the context of the broader landscape.

AB  - Vegetation plays a vital role in the ecological functioning of terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. Remote sensing generally provides timely and accurate information to manage ecosystems sustainably and effectively. In this respect, thermal infrared (TIR, 3–14 µm) remote sensing data form a valuable data source for vegetation studies. The TIR data provides unique information compared to other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This article aims to gather and review the most relevant information obtained using TIR remote sensing data for terrestrial vegetation at leaf and canopy levels using laboratory/field-based, airborne and spaceborne platforms. We address this topic from various angles, particularly focusing on vegetation discrimination as well as the quantification of water stress by means of canopy temperature and spectral emissivity. In addition, attempts to associate TIR spectral features with vegetation biochemical compounds, as well as the retrieval of vegetation biochemical and biophysical parameters, are reviewed. Research needs and requirements for successful use of remote sensing in vegetation studies across the TIR region, as well as significant challenges, are also discussed. Our review reveals that, despite the increasing interest among remote sensing experts in using TIR data, there are still large gaps in our understanding and interpretation of TIR imagery. Some inconsistent findings and contradictory observations have come to light in different levels (i.e., leaf and canopy levels). In addition, our review shows that airborne and TIR hyperspectral-based studies are currently limited due to cost, particularly across large spatial extents. It can be concluded that TIR remote sensing of vegetation offers unique insights in understanding terrestrial vegetation (e.g., vegetation water stress and retrieval of biophysical parameters). TIR is complementary to other remote sensing data sources, with a high potential for fusing data from different parts of the spectrum. However, we highlight challenges obtaining consistent, meaningful and accurate results for land surface temperature and land surface emissivity retrieval.

AB  - Most methods to assess ecosystem services have been developed on large scales and depend on secondary data. Such data is scarce in rural areas with widespread poverty. Nevertheless, the population in these areas strongly depends on local ecosystem services for their livelihoods. These regions are in focus for substantial landscape investments that aim to alleviate poverty, but current methods fail to capture the vast range of ecosystem services supporting livelihoods, and can therefore not properly assess potential trade-offs and synergies among services that might arise from the interventions. We present a new method for classifying village landscapes into social-ecological patches (landscape units corresponding to local landscape perceptions), and for assessing provisioning ecosystem services and benefits to livelihoods from these patches. We apply the method, which include a range of participatory activities and satellite image analysis, in six villages across two regions in Burkina Faso. The results show significant and diverse contributions to livelihoods from six out of seven social-ecological patches. The results also show how provisioning ecosystem services, primarily used for subsistence, become more important sources of income during years when crops fail. The method is useful in many data poor regions, and the patch-approach allows for extrapolation across larger spatial scales with similar social-ecological systems.

AB  - Environmental heterogeneity is considered to be one of the main factors associated with biodiversity given that areas with highly heterogeneous environments can host more species due to their higher number of available niches. In this view, spatial variability extracted from remotely sensed images has been used as a proxy of species diversity, as these data provide an inexpensive means of deriving environmental information for large areas in a consistent and regular manner. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the state of the art in the use of spectral heterogeneity for estimating species diversity. We will examine a number of issues related to this theme, dealing with: i) the main sensors used for biodiversity monitoring, ii) scale matching problems between remotely sensed and field diversity data, iii) spectral heterogeneity measurement techniques, iv) types of species taxonomic diversity measures and how they influence the relationship between spectral and species diversity, v) spectral versus genetic diversity, and vi) modeling procedures for relating spectral and species diversity. Our review suggests that remotely sensed spectral heterogeneity information provides a crucial baseline for rapid estimation or prediction of biodiversity attributes and hotspots in space and time.

AB  - In recent years, the wealth of technological development revolutionised our ability to collect data in geosciences. Due to the unprecedented level of detail of these datasets, geomorphologists are facing new challenges, giving more in-depth answers to a broad(er) range of fundamental questions across the full spectrum of the Earth's (and Planetary) processes. This contribution builds on the existing literature of geomorphometry (the science of quantitative land-surface analysis) and feature extraction (translate land surface parameters into extents of geomorphological elements). It provides evidence of critical themes as well as emerging fields of future research in the digital realm, supporting the likely effectiveness of geomorphometry and feature extractions as they are advancing the theoretical, empirical and applied dimension of geomorphology. The review further discusses the role of geomorphometric legacies, and scientific reproducibility, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action towards improving the transparency, and efficiency of scientific research, and accelerate discoveries in geomorphology. In the current landscape, substantial changes in landforms, ecosystems, land use, hydrological routing, and direct anthropogenic modifications impact systems across the full spectrum of geomorphological processes. Although uncertainties in the precise nature and likelihood of changes exist, geomorphometry and feature extraction can aid exploring process regimes and landscape responses. Taken together, they can revolutionise geomorphology by opening the doors to improved investigations crossing space and time scales, blurring the boundaries between traditional approaches and computer modelling, and facilitating cross-disciplinary research. Ultimately, the exploitation of the available wealth of digital information can help to translate our understanding of geomorphic processes, which is often based on observations of past or current conditions, into the rapidly changing future.

AB  - Securing reliable flows of landscape services is a vital prerequisite for sustaining well-being, especially in the rural Global South, where livelihoods of local communities are dependent on the surrounding village landscapes. To support sustainable landscape development strategies, increased understanding is needed on how landscape services are associated with physical landscapes. In this paper, we studied how place-based landscape services are spatially associated with local land use/land cover (LULC) patterns in three rural villages in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. We mapped the spatial distribution of eight provisioning and one cultural landscape service indicators through participatory mapping and identified their associations with the local LULC patterns using chi-square residual and correlation analysis. Based on our results, LULC patterns are significantly associated with landscape service patterns. Although local realities and interactions have created unique association patterns, some commonalities were found in all villages. This suggests that spatial information on LULC patterns could be used as a proxy for landscape service patterns at broader scales.

AB  - Freshwater scarcity is worsening as we quickly approach the freshwater planetary boundary. There has been extensive research and policy development in the space of water scarcity, pollution and accessibility, centered around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A large body of literature examines household and climate characteristics predictive of water consumption by households. However, there does not appear to be any research on the role of views of and proximity to water bodies in household water consumption. In this paper, we develop a simple model of water consumption which depends on the perceptions of water scarcity and the perceptions of whether water scarcity is an issue. Using geographic information systems (GIS) viewshed analysis, we model whether properties in Tauranga, New Zealand, have views of lakes and the coast. We then use these variables in an SA1 unit fixed effects model of water consumption. We find that views of lakes are associated with higher water consumption and views of the coast are associated with lower water consumption. We suggest that these associations are driven by psychological biases which alter the perceptions of water scarcity and concern for water scarcity. We deploy a range of robustness checks and argue that our results may be causal, though further research is required to confirm this.

AB  - Forest land plays a vital role in global climate, ecosystems, farming and human living environments. Therefore, forest biomass estimation methods are necessary to monitor changes in the forest structure and function, which are key data in natural resources research. Although accurate forest biomass measurements are important in forest inventory and assessment, high-density measurements that involve airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) at a low flight height in large mountainous areas are expensive. The objective of this study was to quantify the aboveground biomass (AGB) of a plateau mountainous forest reserve using a system that synergistically combines an unmanned aircraft system (UAS)-based digital aerial camera and LiDAR to leverage their complementary advantages. In this study, we utilized digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP), which has the unique advantages of speed, high spatial resolution, and low cost, to compensate for the deficiency of forestry inventory using UAS-based LiDAR that requires terrain-following flight for high-resolution data acquisition. Combined with the sparse LiDAR points acquired by using a high-altitude and high-speed UAS for terrain extraction, dense normalized DAP point clouds can be obtained to produce an accurate and high-resolution canopy height model (CHM). Based on the CHM and spectral attributes obtained from multispectral images, we estimated and mapped the AGB of the region of interest with considerable cost efficiency. It is proved that sparse LiDAR point cloud could serve as important sources for terrain estimation. The accuracy of the AGB estimates could be improved by 9% and 5% in terms of the RMSE and R2, respectively, by adding spectral metrics to point cloud structural metrics. Compared with results obtained using only spectral metrics, the results obtained using the combination of spectral and point cloud metrics were better by 37% in terms of the RMSE and 55% in R2. Our study supports the development of predictive models for large-scale wall-to-wall AGB mapping by leveraging the complementarity between DAP and LiDAR measurements. This work also reveals the potential of utilizing a UAS-based digital camera and LiDAR synergistically in a plateau mountainous forest area. In this future, we will further investigate different establishing strategies for combining different sensors in a synergistic system.

AB  - The temporal shoreline position is a key indicator of coastal development and provides information on beach dynamics. Previous studies have indicated that there is a strong relationship between riverine sediment fluxes and beach volume. As such, worldwide hydroelectric projects and the associated damming infrastructure have decreased suspended sediment loads, and consequently increasing coastal erosion and deterioration of wetlands. The study was conducted along the coastline of the San Pedro River and the Santiago River on the Pacific coast of Mexico. Both rivers discharge into the ocean separated by 12 km of coastline, however the San Pedro River does not present dams through its watershed. Contrary, six dams had been constructed along the Santiago River since 1976. Results indicated that after 45 years, the San Pedro River coastline presented minimum variability and a total of 379 ha of accretion. Contrary, the Santiago River coastline showed major erosion trends with a total of 669 ha of beach and wetland losses. Our study highlights the feasibility of combining historical remote sensing data and GIS analysis in order to assess coastal variability trends when field-based surveys are not available.

AB  - As community dwelling populations of older people and those living with chronic and life limiting conditions continue to grow, the role of everyday geographies, particularly of community based settings and activities, in supporting health and wellbeing has become a focus in both research and policy development. The therapeutic landscape scholarship provides a holistic view of how place promotes health and wellbeing, and has in recent years expanded its focus from reputable places of healing to everyday geographies. Based on a scoping review of 45 studies on everyday community based therapeutic landscapes, this paper identifies and critically examines the settings, populations and mechanisms of therapeutic experiences. It presents critical summaries of the scales and boundaries of landscapes; the diverse and dichotomous characteristics of places; the therapeutic benefits of proximal and distal socio-spatial interactions; the role of everyday settings and activities as sources of refuge, anchor and resonance and finally the broader social, cultural, political and economic contexts in which everyday therapeutic landscapes are embedded. In so doing the paper highlights the complex nature of everyday therapeutic landscape experiences and how this research can further inform the development of community based settings and activities that promote health and wellbeing. It also identifies areas for future research on everyday therapeutic landscapes.

AB  - Two corresponding issues concerning Digital Soil Mapping are the demand for up-to-date, fine resolution soil data and the need to determine soil–landscape relationships. In this study, we propose a Bayesian Network framework as a suitable modelling approach to fulfil these requirements. Bayesian Networks are graphical probabilistic models in which predictions are obtained using prior probabilities derived from either measured data or expert opinion. They represent cause and effect relationships through connections in a network system. The advantage of the Bayesian Networks approach is that the models are easy to interpret and the uncertainty inherent in the relationships between variables can be expressed in terms of probability. In this study we will define the fundamentals of a Bayesian Network and the probability theory that underpins predictions. Then, using case studies, we demonstrate how they can be applied to predict soil properties (bulk density) and soil taxonomic class (associations).

AB  - Landscape approaches are prominent in current policy debates about how to achieve ecological, economic and social sustainability. These approaches assess local social-ecological contexts to plan adaptive management and often include indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLC). An important aim of landscape approaches is to integrate different scientific disciplines, indigenous and local knowledge systems (ILK) and Western science, and global and local needs. In practice, such integration tends to favor globalized knowledge models and global needs over local ones. This article introduces a Territorial Social-Ecological Networks (TSEN) Framework for an integrated assessment of landscape settings and dynamics to overcome such tendencies. We argue that both scientific knowledge and ILK are entwined with practice and informed by worldviews. Moreover, these assemblages of knowledges-practice-worldviews are produced by social and ecological interrelations (or networks) that shape human appropriation of territory. We use an approach of methodological bricolage to apply the TSEN Framework to the case of the Brazilian Malhada Grande Maroon Territory. The results highlight how social-ecological networks of different space-time scales co-produce landscapes. Trade-offs and synergies between global and local needs are also discussed and used to identify priority needs that can be addressed by a landscape approach in the area. The analysis suggests that the TSEN Framework may be used by both scientists and practitioners to perform environmental assessments that are inclusive of social and ecological disciplines, of local and Western scientific knowledge, and of global and local needs in a landscape.

AB  - Headwater streams and inland wetlands provide essential functions that support healthy watersheds and downstream waters. However, scientists and aquatic resource managers lack a comprehensive synthesis of national and state stream and wetland geospatial datasets and emerging technologies that can further improve these data. We conducted a review of existing United States (US) federal and state stream and wetland geospatial datasets, focusing on their spatial extent, permanence classifications, and current limitations. We also examined recent peer-reviewed literature for emerging methods that can potentially improve the estimation, representation, and integration of stream and wetland datasets. We found that federal and state datasets rely heavily on the US Geological Survey's National Hydrography Dataset for stream extent and duration information. Only eleven states (22%) had additional stream extent information and seven states (14%) provided additional duration information. Likewise, federal and state wetland datasets primarily use the US Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) Geospatial Dataset, with only two states using non-NWI datasets. Our synthesis revealed that LiDAR-based technologies hold promise for advancing stream and wetland mapping at limited spatial extents. While machine learning techniques may help to scale-up these LiDAR-derived estimates, challenges related to preprocessing and data workflows remain. High-resolution commercial imagery, supported by public imagery and cloud computing, may further aid characterization of the spatial and temporal dynamics of streams and wetlands, especially using multi-platform and multi-temporal machine learning approaches. Models integrating both stream and wetland dynamics are limited, and field-based efforts must remain a key component in developing improved headwater stream and wetland datasets. Continued financial and partnership support of existing databases is also needed to enhance mapping and inform water resources research and policy decisions.

AB  - This paper investigates index models as a tool to estimate the risk of N and P source strengths and loss at the catchment scale. The index models assist managers in improving the focus of remediation actions that reduce nutrient delivery to waterbodies. N and P source risk factors (e.g. soil nutrient concentrations) and transport risk factors (e.g. distance-to-streams) are used to determine the overall risk of nutrient loss for a case study in the Tuross River catchment of coastal southeast Australia. In the development of the N index model for Tuross, particulate N was considered important based on the observed event water quality data. In contrast to previous N index models, erosion and contributing distance were therefore included in the Tuross River catchment N index. Event-based water quality monitoring, and soil information, or in data-poor catchments conceptual understanding, are essential to represent catchment-scale processes. The techniques have high applicability in other catchments, and are complementary to other modelling techniques such as process-based semi-distributed modelling. Index models generally provide much more detailed spatial resolution than fully- or semi-distributed conceptual modelling approaches. Semi-distributed models can be used to quantify nutrient loads and provide overall direction to set the broad focus of management. Index models can then be used to refine on-the-ground investigations and investment priorities. In this way semi-distributed models can be combined with index models to provide a set of powerful tools to influence management decisions and outcomes.

AB  - Submarine landslides constitute a geohazard to humans and their infrastructures. Recent studies, supported by the rapid advances in seafloor mapping technology, have shown that submarine landslides are important geological processes in terms of their widespread occurrence, their size and the volume of sediment they displace. Submarine mass movement processes are, however, poorly understood. The investigation of submarine landslides still presents a challenge to marine geomorphologists today because of their large scale and inaccessibility. The type of information on submarine landslides that is available to the marine geoscientist is generally morphological and acquired remotely. For these reasons, geomorphological mapping has become an important tool in the study of submarine landslides. In this chapter, I review the methods used by marine geomorphologists to generate geomorphological maps of submarine landslides, assess the characteristics of these maps and suggest ways in which they can be improved. I will also demonstrate the utility of geomorphological mapping in assessing the risk associated with an offshore gas field development and in improving our understanding of submarine landslide dynamics in the Storegga Slide off the Norwegian coast.

AB  - Despite decades of archaeological research, roughly 75% of Madagascar's land area remains archaeologically unexplored and the oldest sites on the island are difficult to locate, as they contain the ephemeral remains of mobile hunter/forager campsites. The known archaeological record is therefore biased toward later sites, especially sites dating to the second millennium AD, following the expansion of Indian Ocean trading networks. Systematic archaeological investigations are required to address these biases in the known archaeological record and clarify the island's early human history, but funding limitations, logistical and time constraints in surveying large areas and a relatively small number of active field archaeologists present substantial barriers to expansive areal survey coverage. Using theoretical models derived from human behavioral ecology (i.e., ideal free distribution, optimal foraging theory) in conjunction with freely available remote sensing data, we illustrate how archaeological survey of Madagascar's landscapes can be rapidly expanded, more effectively target early archaeological deposits, and address questions about the island's settlement. This study illustrates the potential for theoretically-driven satellite-based remote sensing analysis to improve our understanding of the archaeological record of the world's fourth largest island.

AB  - The trajectory of the urban heat island (UHI) centroid in three dimensions indicates the overall variation of the intensity and distribution of the UHI. This study applied the Gaussian volume model on the daily MODIS/LST products from 2000 to 2012 to derive the UHI centroid in Beijing on a multi-temporal scale. The trajectories indicated that (1) on a diurnal scale during July–September, the daytime and nighttime centroids of the UHI were primarily located in the Xicheng district near the city center, and the mean intensity was from 2.12 to 2.97°C. The daytime centroid was in the south of the nighttime centroid and demonstrated a higher intensity and a larger core area, where Aqua obtains a higher intensity than Terra. The movement of the UHI centroid was also more significant in the north–south direction than in the east–west direction; (2) on a monthly scale, the daytime centroid moved from the northeast to the southwest by (1.85, 2.91) km from July to September, and the intensity varied from 2.16°C (September) to 3.09°C (August), while the nighttime centroid generally moved anticlockwise from January to December, and the intensity varied from 1.98°C (July) to 3.07°C (January); and (3) on an annual scale, the daytime UHI centroid in August and the nighttime UHI centroid moved toward the northeast by (2.15, 1.31) km and (0.43, 0.89) km, respectively. There was a dramatic change in the UHI prior to 2008, which was most likely caused by the numerous preparation projects for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the hot and medium-hot landscapes exhibited positive contributions to the variation of the horizontal location of UHI centroid, and NDVI and albedo showed positive contributions to the variations of daytime (less than 10%) and nighttime (close to 50%) UHI centroids, respectively. Also, we discussed the relationship between Z-dimension of UHI centroid and other UHI indicators, and the impact of missing data. This study presents scientific insights for urban planning and management in Beijing and motivates the investigation of comprehensive changes in UHI of other metropolises worldwide.

AB  - Biodiversity loss is one of the great challenges of our times, and it is primarily driven by losses of natural and semi-natural areas. To avoid further biodiversity losses, landscape planning and ecosystem management could benefit from a condensed measure that tracks regional and cumulative ecological degradation from past and ongoing landscape changes. The affected species communities can be described spatially explicit by biotopes. A vulnerability map of biotopes will identify areas with a high potential to be adversely affected and a low capacity to recover. These vulnerability hot spots may require specific protection and maintenance interventions to be sustained. Following the interdisciplinary vulnerability concept, an indicator set related to landscape change was developed for the biotopes of the biosphere reserve Schorfheide-Chorin (Germany), which have been mapped as vector data according to the Brandenburg mapping key. The indicator set was structured into indicators of biotope exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It covered patch metrics, like the size, the fractal dimension, and the amount of similar patches in the surrounding of each patch, as well as class metrics, like the mesh size, the state of endangerment and the average dispersal range of each biotope type. The resulting vulnerability index covered a biotope area of around 130,000 ha, and the study area could be extended readily. European biotopes are already mapped and monitored across large areas, primarily for nature conservation purposes. The biotope vulnerability index developed within this study is intended for application at large spatial scales and has the potential for a straightforward transfer to biotope maps from other German federal states and European regions.

AB  - Water and energy balance interactions with vegetation in mountainous terrain are influenced by topographic effects, spatial variation in vegetation type and density, and water availability. This is the case for the mountainous areas of northern Portugal, where ancestral irrigated meadows (lameiros) are a main component of a complex vegetation mosaic. The widely used surface energy balance model METRIC was applied to four Landsat images to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of the energy balance terms in the identified land cover types (LCT). A discussion on the variability of evapotranspiration (ET) through the various vegetation types was supported by a comparison between the respective crop coefficients and those available in the literature corresponding to the LCT, which has shown the appropriateness of METRIC estimates of ET. METRIC products derived from images of May and June – NDVI, surface temperature, net radiation, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux, and ET – were used to characterize the LCTs, through application of principal component analysis. Three principal components explained the variance of observed variables and their varimax rotated loadings allowed a good explanation of the behaviour of the explanatory variables in association with the LCTs. Information gained contributes to improve the characterization of the study area and may further support conservation and management of these mountain landscapes.

AB  - Modern intensive agricultural practices are causing stress on ecosystems worldwide, with the loss of biodiversity due to decreased landscape heterogeneity as well as high use of synthetic agro-chemicals. Organic farming is seen as an effective way of counteracting this trend. Despite this, relatively little research has been carried out on the effects of olive farming on biodiversity in Greece. This study uses bioacoustic monitoring for a first order assessment of the bird diversity in olive groves. It uses acoustic indices to compare the soundscape of eleven organic and eleven conventional olive groves in Messinia in southern Greece. Three bioacoustics indices: the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), the Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI) and the Bioacoustic Index (BIO) were used. Olive groves under organic farming had significantly higher values for the ACI and BIO indices, and a higher but not significant different value for the ADI index. Organic groves showed a much more heterogeneous and complex structure with a mixture of tree species and varying canopy height than conventional groves. Landscape variables were similar between management practices and did not influence the index results. Site level variables, especially underlying vegetation height, had a significant influence on the ACI and BIO indices. Our results suggest that bioacoustic indices could provide a cost effective and non-intrusive way for bird diversity monitoring.

AB  - The Peruvian Amazon has undergone extensive changes in land-use and land-cover changes in the last decades related to policy implementation at local to national scales. Understanding the complexity of such changes is one of the more important challenges at present and requires research approaches capable of spanning temporal and spatial scales and academic disciplines. Here, we investigate the impacts of agriculture incentives and infrastructure development in the Southeastern Peruvian Amazon using such an approach. We integrate Landsat satellite derived land-cover maps spanning the years 1986 and 2006 to understand the land-use/land-cover changes, including forest, crops and pasture, and secondary vegetation, and their implications stemming from voluntary policy adoption along the Iñapari-Iberia portion of the Inter-Oceanic highway. This road portion is one component of the broader Initiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure expansion, which is resulting in rapid and extensive socio-economic and biophysical changes in the region. Results from this research highlight that changes in land-cover are associated with the farmers' voluntary adoption of agricultural policies, and that policies associated with cattle expansion and credit incentives, among others, have greatly influenced forest conversion. Although land-use/land-cover change causes are manifold and linked to more than policy events, the method used in this study improves the understanding of the effects of complex policy processes in this biodiversity and culturally rich region of the Amazon.

AB  - A spatial value transfer analysis was performed to generate baseline estimates of the value of ecosystem services in the coastal zone of Catalonia, Spain. The study used the best available conceptual frameworks, data sources, and analytical techniques to generate non-market monetary value estimates that can be used to identify scarce ecosystem services among competing coastal uses. The approach focused on natural and seminatural, terrestrial and marine systems, which provide essential services that are not considered in current economic markets. Results show that in 2004 a substantial economic value of $3,195 million USD/yr was delivered to local citizens by surrounding ecosystems. In a spatially explicit manner, the approach illustrates the contribution made by natural environmental systems to the well being of communities in the coastal zone of Catalonia. It is hoped that this study will highlight the need to consider these coastal systems in future management strategies to ensure their proper maintenance and conservation.

AB  - Cropland extent maps are useful components for assessing food security. Ideally, such products are a useful addition to countrywide agricultural statistics since they are not politically biased and can be used to calculate cropland area for any spatial unit from an individual farm to various administrative unites (e.g., state, county, district) within and across nations, which in turn can be used to estimate agricultural productivity as well as degree of disturbance on food security from natural disasters and political conflict. However, existing cropland extent maps over large areas (e.g., Country, region, continent, world) are derived from coarse resolution imagery (250 m to 1 km pixels) and have many limitations such as missing fragmented and\or small farms with mixed signatures from different crop types and\or farming practices that can be, confused with other land cover. As a result, the coarse resolution maps have limited useflness in areas where fields are small (<1 ha), such as in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, coarse resolution cropland maps have known uncertainties in both geo-precision of cropland location as well as accuracies of the product. To overcome these limitations, this research was conducted using multi-date, multi-year 30-m Landsat time-series data for 3 years chosen from 2013 to 2016 for all Southeast and Northeast Asian Countries (SNACs), which included 7 refined agro-ecological zones (RAEZ) and 12 countries (Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Cambodia, Japan, North Korea, Laos, South Korea, and Brunei). The 30-m (1 pixel = 0.09 ha) data from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) were used in the study. Ten Landsat bands were used in the analysis (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2, Thermal, NDVI, NDWI, LSWI) along with additional layers of standard deviation of these 10 bands across 1 year, and global digital elevation model (GDEM)-derived slope and elevation bands. To reduce the impact of clouds, the Landsat imagery was time-composited over four time-periods (Period 1: January- April, Period 2: May-August, and Period 3: September-December) over 3-years. Period 4 was the standard deviation of all 10 bands taken over all images acquired during the 2015 calendar year. These four period composites, totaling 42 band data-cube, were generated for each of the 7 RAEZs. The reference training data (N = 7849) generated for the 7 RAEZ using sub-meter to 5-m very high spatial resolution imagery (VHRI) helped generate the knowledge-base to separate croplands from non-croplands. This knowledge-base was used to code and run a pixel-based random forest (RF) supervised machine learning algorithm on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing environment to separate croplands from non-croplands. The resulting cropland extent products were evaluated using an independent reference validation dataset (N = 1750) in each of the 7 RAEZs as well as for the entire SNAC area. For the entire SNAC area, the overall accuracy was 88.1% with a producer’s accuracy of 81.6% (errors of omissions = 18.4%) and user’s accuracy of 76.7% (errors of commissions = 23.3%). For each of the 7 RAEZs overall accuracies varied from 83.2 to 96.4%. Cropland areas calculated for the 12 countries were compared with country areas reported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and other national cropland statistics resulting in an R2 value of 0.93. The cropland areas of provinces were compared with the province statistics that showed an R2 = 0.95 for South Korea and R2 = 0.94 for Thailand. The cropland products are made available on an interactive viewer at www.croplands.org and for download at National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC): https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/1281.

AB  - An increasing number of studies have reported on the need to augment public electric vehicle (EV) charging points (E-CPs) in areas with growing demand for parking. However, the focus on E-CP infrastructure equity has largely been ignored. For increased uptake of EVs, we argue that future E-CP infrastructure augmentation (EIA) will necessitate the identification of the optimal locations based on a need-focused strategic approach. Our work utilises open datasets and presents a generic multicriteria-based modelling framework for EIA framework. The E-CP Infrastructure Framework a two-stage framework. The first stage assesses the existing infrastructure gap and spatial disparity of E-CP allocation at the city scale. Next, guided by the information from stage one, stage two identifies the optimal E-CP candidate locations for future EIA expansion. The locations are determined using a parametric scoring approach that includes ease of access, available bays for parked vehicles, and potential congestion risk. We take the example of Dresden city to demonstrate the applicability of the EIA framework. Our findings show the wide prevalence of spatial disparities in E-CPs across nine of the ten wards in the city. Our proposed city-scale approach for identifying candidate locations could help policymakers decide on the augmentation strategies of E-CP infrastructure in a spatially equitable and cost-effective manner.

AB  - Remote sensing, geographical information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis provide important tools that are as yet under-exploited in the fight against disease. As the use of such tools becomes more accepted and prevalent in epidemiological studies, so our understanding of the mechanisms of disease systems has the potential to increase. This paper introduces a range of techniques used in remote sensing, GIS and spatial analysis that are relevant to epidemiology. Possible future directions for the application of remote sensing, GIS and spatial analysis are also suggested.
