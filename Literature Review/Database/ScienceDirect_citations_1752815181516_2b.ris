AB  - This paper deals with the process of integration required to study multifunctionality in agricultural landscapes. It examines what we really understand by integration between subject disciplines and how we can move from independent parallel disciplinary studies carried out in the same area to increasing degrees of interdisciplinarity. I explore the current interest in interdisciplinarity with the aim of mapping out what we can expect interdisciplinary research to achieve and what it will not. The main part of the paper examines the process of working across subject boundaries, and the problems from practical and theoretical perspectives. The major barriers facing interdisciplinarity in landscape research are academic traditions, the merit system and lack of theory. To meet the challenges of interdisciplinarity, we need to focus on theory development, training of researchers, team building, finding common aims and rewarding good practice. Finally, I discuss the drafting of a code of good practice and criteria for assessing quality in interdisciplinary research.

AB  - Since 2005, Environmental Stewardship (ES) has been the principal agri-environment scheme for England and is the key instrument for the delivery of increased environmental benefits from agricultural landscapes. The main objective of this study is to investigate whether or not individuals' preferences for the environmental benefits associated with ES vary depending on types of landscapes within which these benefits are delivered. A latent class model is applied to data obtained from a choice experiment survey of over 1000 respondents sampled across England. The results suggest that individuals have heterogenous preferences for the benefits of ES, though different segments of the population with more homogenous preferences can be identified. In particular, higher levels of benefit are often associated with the operation of ES in landscapes close to where respondents live. This leads to the suggestion that, in order to maximise the benefits of ES, its implementation could take this result into account by encouraging greater uptake from farmers whose land is closer to large populations.

AB  - The central aim of this study was to gain greater insights into the factors that affect individuals' preferences for a variety of landscape settings. Using a nationally representative survey conducted in the summer of 2010 of 430 individuals living in Ireland, this paper derived dependent variables (based on a factor analysis of respondents mean ratings of 47 landscape images) representing 5 different landscape categories. These variables were then utilised in separate OLS regression models to examine the effect of personal characteristics, residential location and environmental value orientations on landscape preferences. First in terms of visual amenity the results suggest that the general public have the strongest preference for landscapes with water related features as its dominant attribute which was followed by cultural landscapes. Second the results also demonstrate how there is significant heterogeneity in landscape preferences as both personal characteristics and environmental value orientations were found to strongly influence preferences for all the landscape types examined. Moreover the effect of these variables often differed significantly across the various landscape groupings. In terms of land use policy, given the diversity of preferences a one size fits all approach will not meet the general publics' needs and desires.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the role that remotely sensed data play in improving the ability to document the distribution of global land cover types. If the relationships between the cover types and trace gas fluxes can be determined, then the dynamics of these fluxes can be established. The chapter discusses important aquatic systems—such as wetlands—and the land–water interface. Researchers have a wide variety of options available to utilize the remotely sensed data for the scaling of trace gas fluxes between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and the atmosphere. An important application of remote sensing for improving the understanding of trace gas fluxes is the classification of land cover types. Remote sensing is a powerful tool for the collection of environmental data. When combined with other more conventional data, they can be analyzed to extract a wide variety of environmental themes. Models can be developed for improving the fundamental understanding of the dynamics of complex interconnected systems that support and sustain life on earth.

AB  - Sustaining agricultural environments requires explicit recognition of the services provided by landscapes, particularly cultural ecosystem services that are contested and underrepresented in previous research. We assembled and engaged a panel of experts to identify and deliberate on the relationships among ecosystem services, threats and land management practices in an agricultural watershed using a Delphi method. We also drew from focus group results to gain an in-depth understanding of how participants valued the Kaskaskia River Watershed, Illinois. Results revealed that diverse benefits were derived from provisioning (e.g., crop production), regulating (e.g., flood prevention), supporting (e.g., soil formation), and cultural (e.g., farming lifestyle) services provided by the watershed. A disproportionately higher number of cultural services were identified and rated as highly important. Multiple threats, including erosion and nutrient loading, were associated with agricultural, forest and lake and river environments, highlighting the importance of connectivity across ecosystems. To mitigate and adapt to change, particularly around the provision of agro-ecosystem services, stakeholders benefit from collective discussions about land management practices such as reduced tillage and zoning policies. Engaging local stakeholders in deliberation provides a rich basis for understanding the multiple values of worked landscapes and establishing sustainable agricultural practices.

AB  - Agricultural land abandonment is a policy challenge, especially for areas with unfavorable conditions for agriculture and remote and mountainous areas. Agricultural abandonment is an important land use process in many world regions and one of the dominant land use change processes in Europe. Previous studies have shown that abandonment can have both positive and negative effects on several environmental processes, influenced by location and scale. Preferred policies and management of these areas are debated given concerns for the loss of (traditional) agricultural landscapes and potential impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. We present a European-scale impact assessment of the possible effects of agricultural abandonment, based on eight indicators that are on the forefront of the agricultural abandonment debate. Using a multi-scale modelling approach, we expect between 71.277 and 211.814km2 of agricultural abandonment in 2040. Impacts on the indicators and trade-offs between the impacts are spatially variable. A typology of typical trade-off bundles at a 1km2 resolution resulted in four typical trade-off clusters. All clusters identified are characterized by a loss of agriculture-related values, such as agro-biodiversity and cultural heritage. For two clusters, this was accompanied by positive effects on indicators such as carbon sequestration, nature recreation and mammal habitat suitability. Overall, our results indicate that location and scale are key to assess the trade-offs originating from agricultural abandonment in Europe. Identification of typical trade-offs bundles can help to distinguish potential desirable outcomes of agricultural abandonment and assist in targeting measures to areas that face similar management challenges.

AB  - De Veer, A.A. and Burrough, P.A., 1978. Physiognomic landscape mapping in The Netherlands. Landscape Plann., 5: 45–62. Although physiognomic landscape studies have been used for 10 years by planners in The Netherlands, there have been few comparisons of the various methodologies. Also, publication of the methods in English has been rare. A brief description of the most important visible aspects (physiognomy) of Dutch landscapes is followed by a review of techniques used from 1966–1976 for classifying and mapping landscapes for planning purposes. Three main approaches have been recognized — “compartment”; “breadth of view”; and “grid cell”. The findings of a recent study comparing the results and techniques of different Dutch landscape classification methods are summarized and discussed in the light of the stated requirements of users of landscape data. As no single extant technique satisfies all the users' requirements, future developments in landscape mapping should adopt a more flexible approach. Recent experience in using computer-assisted mapping methods in soil science and geology suggests that these techniques can be adapted profitably to classify and map landscapes from elementary data according to users' needs.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) have the potential to aid in the restoration of ecosystem services and biodiversity in cities, but this function is often diluted because ecological processes are ignored in favour of ‘tidiness’. While the general public is not fond of unkempt greenery, a less-manicured UGS that balances the spontaneous growth of plants and maintenance regimes may be accepted. The paper describes a study exploring accepted degrees of UGS wildness, specifically areas that are currently mown lawns. In the study, a photo elicitation survey administered two sets of photos to two groups of respondents, 663 members of the general population and an additional 48 members of nature/environmental interest groups. The survey assessed perceptions of managed greenery, with three different degrees of growth of lawns in four contexts and six types of landscape elements in wilder lawns. The study found the preferred level of wildness of UGS varied depending on the context, people were generally not against moderately wilder UGS. The utilitarian aspect of landscape was a primary factor in the preference for less-manicured lawns, and aesthetics were a secondary factor. Also, general population characteristics did not consistently predict preference for any vegetation growth condition, and landscape elements differentially affected the degree of preference for wilder lawns. The article concludes by discussing the practical consequences of these findings for the inclusion of wilder UGS in design and management.

AB  - As the largest holder of shale gas resource estimates, China is actively promoting its shale gas development to steer its transitions to a low carbon energy system. The production of shale gas usually needs a large amount of water. According to our estimates, the direct water consumption is about 9700–37600m3/well, and the indirect water consumption is around 32,400–71,100 m3/well. Such a large amount of water consumption could have a serious impact on local human and ecosystem water consumption since China is a country with scarce and unevenly distributed water resources. Water scarcity footprint (WSF) of shale gas production in Chinese provinces is assessed to understand the impacts of shale gas production on local water consumption for other sectors. The results show that the average water pressure for shale gas production in China is higher compared with that of the U.S.. The average WSF in China is 16,574 m3 world. eq/106m3 gas while the WSF in the Barnett shale region in the U.S. is only around 2000 m3 world. eq/106m3 gas. 13 of 31 provinces have even higher WSF than the national average, in which the amount of shale gas resources accounts for about 20% of China's total. Shale gas exploitation in these 13 provinces might not be suitable or must be cautious from the perspective of WSF. The remaining 18 provinces have lower WSFs than the national average. A sustainable way for extracting shale gas in these 18 provinces needs to comprehensively consider WSF, the scale and speed of exploitation and the amount of local shale gas recoverable reserves.

AB  - Urban representation refers to how cities are portrayed, visualized, and interpreted as texts that can be read or analyzed. Representations reflect the world but also intervene in it, inviting considerations of the relationships between material landscapes and the visual or textual ways in which they are engaged with by artists, writers, residents, and decision makers. Paying attention to representation invites urbanists and urban geographers to reflect on their own positioning in relation to contemporary urban thought and to understand their role as actively intervening into the urban landscape itself. Urban scholarship is itself a representational process, one with implications for how cities around the world are understood, experienced, and engaged with. The study of urban representation is cohered through three distinct frameworks: The City as Text, Representing and Intervening in the City, and Urban Policy as Representation. In each case, urban representation is understood to refer to both how cities are reflected in art practice and scholarship as well as to how cities are themselves representations of broader processes and dynamics.

In this paper, the steps of LCAS research are as follows: Describes the concepts of the landscape characteristic aesthetic structure (LCAS), and expounds the LCAS properties: systematic quality, temporal and spatial quality, and virtual existence. Learns from typology research methods, discusses the elements and types needed in a landscape characteristic aesthetic system, and constructs research method for LCAS pattern. As for the temporal dimension, the dynamic evolution and interaction expressed in LCAS between the “tradition” and “modernity” landscapes conflict. As for the spatial dimension, this paper explores the LCAS patterns in macroscopic scope of city group, the middle scope of single cities and the microcosmic scope of urban spaces with questionnaires and examples research. Uses pattern language to express different LCAS types in the temporal and spatial system. We develop the patterns of various LCAS types with graphical patterned representation, as well as construct the LCAS research method and theory which is based on the general people's aesthetic standards and sensibilities to build city characteristics and urban landscapes as a guidance.

AB  - Changes in socio-cultural patterns, economic activities, and the technologies for agricultural productions and climate controls are bringing new patterns of visual qualities to the age-old vernacular landscape of Saudi Arabia's Asir region. Unfortunately, the lack of reference between old and new is threatening to destroy the overall environmental quality that is one of the region's greatest economic and cultural assets. Through detailed examination of Al-Alkhalaf vernacular landscape in Asir, one of the largest villages, this paper defines the major components of the landscape and assesses the basis for their aesthetic qualities and values. Throughout the traditional era, a sense of beauty was imparted to this vernacular landscape through an unconscious balancing of natural systems and human needs. Such result owed much to the management efforts of a homogenous group of villagers expressing consensus about their place in the world. Today, in the more complicated context of modern Saudi Arabia, a new appreciation for landscape traditions arises and vernacular invites pertinent commentaries. A more conscious effort is needed to achieve the same old sense of regional and aesthetic values. The paper suggests that such an effort should begin by employing concepts like aesthetic values, aesthetic qualities and visual qualities when searching for new expressions of the relationship between people and nature.

AB  - The assessment of agricultural performance in the last decades has been forced to move away from a single criterion of productivity towards broader viewpoints. This article focuses on the feasibility of agri-environmental indicators that are aimed to be used for international comparisons. Indicators of two widely known international organizations, OECD and the Commission of European Communities, were evaluated from the viewpoint of national case study. There exist already plenty of methodology to describe agri-environmental development, which mean that future decision-makers will be better informed about the changes of agricultural systems. Data sets are, however, heterogeneous, which needs be carefully acknowledged by the users. Moreover, characteristic feature of agri-environmental indicators is, that they are producing information in a given problem structuring. Therefore, they are unable to recognize the specific properties of each case study. They are providing relevant statistics, but are still missing for the framework, which would open the meaning of numbers and show the relevance of notices within the particular case study.

The concept behind the innovative green roof design is to break down perceived barriers to green roof retrofitting, limit the global temperature rise and help cool the city by advocating modifications in urban infrastructure (e.g. greening projects). This study quantified the cooling effect of the complex green rooftop of Treasury Place (which is characterised by a diverse range of plant types and topographies) by using ENVI-met to assess the air temperature and outdoor thermal comfort at rooftop and pedestrian levels. After verification through field measurements, the study also investigated how the adjustments in the green roof's design settings (e.g. leaf area index [LAI], plant height, soil moisture and additional green coverage) can further improve the green roof's thermal performance. The findings from our study indicate that the implemented green roof configuration effectively lowered the air temperatures at the roof level by 1.5 °C, simultaneously enhancing thermal comfort by 2.38 °C during hot summer days. This optimum performance was achieved when soil moisture levels were set at 0.6, plant height at 0.6, and LAI at 2.5. Our statistical analysis indicates that all these scenarios exhibited equivalent cooling benefits. Thus, a holistic approach optimizing LAI, plant height, soil moisture, and tree coverage combined is essential to maximise cooling impact when integrating green roofs into future developments in inner city areas.

AB  - The assessment of the potential landscape impacts of the latest Common Agricultural Policy reforms constitutes a challenge for policy makers and it requires the development of models that can reliably project the likely spatial distribution of land uses. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of 2003 CAP reforms to land uses and rural landscapes across England. For this purpose we modified an existing economic model of agriculture, the Land-Use Allocation Model (LUAM) to provide outputs at a scale appropriate for informing a semi-quantitative landscape assessment at the level of ‘Joint Character Areas’ (JCAs). Overall a decline in the cereal and oilseed production area is projected but intensive arable production will persist in specific locations (East of England, East Midlands and South East), having ongoing negative effects on the character of many JCAs. The impacts of de-coupling will be far more profound on the livestock sector; extensification of production will occur in traditional mixed farming regions (e.g. the South West), a partial displacement of cattle by sheep in the upland regions and an increase in the sheep numbers is expected in the lowlands (South East, Eastern and East Midlands). This extensification process will affect positively those JCAs of mixed farming conditions, but it will have negative impacts on the JCAs of historically low intensity farming (e.g. the uplands of north-west) because they will suffer from under-management and land idling. Our analysis shows that the territorialisation between intensively and extensively agricultural landscapes will continue.

AB  - Cemeteries constitute some of oldest and largest green and open spaces in Beirut. With the rapid densification of the city, and the extensive loss of green space, understanding the potential of these sites, as multifunctional landscapes, is critical for the health and sustainability of the city. Few studies on cemeteries have investigated the social and recreational values of these specific spaces, focusing mainly on the observation of the existing users and their current activities on site. As far as we know, none have examined how potential users may perceive them and what they may see as attractive in them. This exploratory study aims to investigate different perceptions of urban cemeteries in Beirut and identify preferred characteristics and landscape features that render them attractive green spaces. Face-to face interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire and a photo-sorting exercise were conducted with 29 participants. Quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed that not all cemeteries are perceived in the same way and that the presence of greenery, stewardship through organization, maintenance and care, as well as restorative qualities linked to privacy and the sense of being away from the city, were main criteria for positive perception and preference. Crowdedness, unequal treatment of dead and intrusion from surrounding context, both physically and ideologically were perceived as negative constructs and were linked to the least preferred images of cemeteries. While religious affiliations did not seem to impact preference or perception, the presence of political influence through signs and symbols was highly condemned within urban cemeteries.

AB  - Urbanization and densification have extended some urban greenery skyward. Understanding expectations of aboveground green space can enhance public support and benefits. We evaluated the perceived benefits and preference for landscape elements of green roofs based on a questionnaire survey of 477 Hong Kong residents using principal component and cluster analyses. Benefits on recreation and health, air quality, and microclimate were strongly expected, but ecological and hydrological benefits were inadequately recognized. Respondents strongly preferred recreational hardware facilities like seats, kiosks and footpaths, soft landscape features like lawns, attractive flowers, pergolas and hedges, and simple ornamental planting design with low-stature vegetation and low biomass structure and complexity. Tree planting was the least desired among the three planting types. Hard landscape features were the least preferred, and some groups expected water features. Preference profiles identified six clusters of respondents, with inter-cluster dissimilarity associated with socio-demographic characteristics and benefit perception. The findings suggested that public education could enhance citizens’ knowledge on benefits to secure their support of environmentally-sound green roof design and a need for the user-oriented design of green roofs to cater to specific potential users. Strategically located sited could alleviate accessibility inequality in urban green space, especially for low-income people.

AB  - Holism deals with extremely complex structures that are difficult to analyse. The holistic approach of landscape research was stimulated by the introduction of aerial photography. Carl Troll called “aerial photo-interpretation as a high degree of landscape ecology,” which illustrates the intimate link between the bio-philosophical theory of holism and the Gestalt-theory of human perception, which is important in image interpretation. Aerial photography proved to be a valuable instrument, not only to make thematic inventories and monitor changes, but also to describe holistic aspects of complex landscapes. Contrarily, the analytical approach aims to describe transcendent characteristics of complex structures by quantitative variables. Many landscape metrics have been proposed and used, such as entropy as an indicator of fragmentation and heterogeneity. A comparison was made between a typology and classification of a highly complex suburban landscape with aid of a holistic-based approach for visual interpretation of aerial photographs and a quantitative approach using landscape metrics of the patches formed by the land use. The study area covers the suburban transition of the city of Ghent (Flanders, Belgium) to the rural countryside to the west and is characterised by a large diversity of land use and a severe fragmentation of infrastructures. The visual interpretation of aerial photographs allowed rapid and easy classification into 10 distinct and landscape types, which could be mapped. The landscape metrics used were patch area, patch shape, fractal dimension of the patch borders and two forms of information entropy. The metrics were derived from the land use map based upon a supervised classification of satellite data and improved by ancillary data with a resolution of 20m. Overall, the fractal dimension and entropy are significantly different for the landscape types, while those for the patch area and shape are not. Landscape metrics are very sensitive to data quality, particularly in complex and very heterogeneous landscapes. Interpretation of the results is also made more difficult due to the effects caused by the algorithms of spatial analysis used to determine patches, and due to the noise added by index calculation. These effects are reflected on maps representing the distribution of the landscape metrics. The patterns revealed here depend largely upon the method of classification and visualisation. The summed entropy corresponds most closely to the landscape units defined by visual image interpretation. It can be used as a quantitative characteristic of holistically defined landscape units.

This study conducts a systematic review of urban agglomeration studies, develops a general typology of urban agglomeration, and delineates its evolving theories. It also probes into the two major sub-concepts of urban agglomeration research, arguing that there are sub-themes in these two similar concepts that investigate economic activities in urban agglomerations with distinctive foci. With a bibliometric analysis and intensive review of selected articles, we analyze the development of theories in different terrains of urban agglomeration research and their underpinning influencing factors and dynamics. These help depict the overlaps and differences of the sub-concepts and different terrains. Finally, a systematic architecture is established for trans-disciplinary urban agglomeration research that integrates the fragmented multi-disciplinary studies involved and serves as a benchmark to position subsequent studies in urban agglomeration research.

AB  - A regional greenway network is proposed to reconnect ecologically the fragmented landscapes of south Florida. The natural landscapes of the region have been progressively fragmented on account of agricultural and urban development. It is proposed that the regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees, which was originally developed to facilitate agriculture and urbanization, be ecologically reclaimed and managed to become a network of environmental restoration and cultural opportunity for south Florida. The existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees is restrictively underutilized. In general, the value of utility and transportation corridors as natural and cultural resources has not been fully appreciated in south Florida. Their value as resources lies in the ample opportunity they offer for landscape revegetation, wetland reclamation, habitat restoration, and community education and recreation. In particular, the existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees represents an extensive resource that can naturally and culturally link the fragmented landscapes of south Florida while maintaining flood control and water conservation. A tripartite method, based on the ecological principles of island biogeography theory and landscape network theory, is used to consider the geographical, morphological, and topological impact on natural diversity and cultural use. Respectively, the effects of network corridor area, network corridor width, and network connectivity and circuitry are described, analyzed, and evaluated for their potential effect on natural diversity and cultural use along the existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees. Results indicate that the proposed regional greenway network is characterized by a large area, broad extent, morphological diversity, and topological connectivity. Variation in greenway structure and function along the regional network can accommodate a multitude of environmental concerns and cultural needs faced by the region. The regional greenway network affords ample flexibility, with three types of corridors (line, strip, and stream) within four types of context (urban, suburban, rural, and natural). Recommendations are made to appraise opportunities further at the regional level, conduct ecological corridor research at the landscape scale, and develop a greenway prototype at a specific community site.

AB  - The landscapes of a territory are the consequence of its history; overlapped geological, vegetable and cultural histories usually exist on a landscape. At the Mediterranean domain, however, a translucent vegetation exists, and its history is closely related to the geologic and cultural histories, because low-technology agricultural uses on a different hardness rock background control vegetation. Thus, in areas like the Guadalajara province, the geologic composition and the human activities can be considered the primary conditions for landscape configuration. Both condition the typologies, distribution and relative importance of the geotic, biotic and anthropogenic components of landscapes. A complex network of interrelations among all them exists but, in the base of which lie the geology of the territory, included relief, because it has a more independent influence since man cannot modify the geologic factors; such as the colour of the rocks, the size and distribution of rock bodies, the palaeogeographic domains and the tectonic structure all which control landscape development and configuration. Moreover, geology influences conditions and even limit, the presence, typologies and development of the biotic and anthropogenic elements. These factors also have a major relevance for environmental management, educational and economic policy, and, in some cases, for environmental impact assessment.

AB  - We present a Python toolbox for the calculation of zonal landscape metrics. Instead of global calculations focusing on the whole landscape, the proposed ZonalMetrics toolbox allows the calculation of landscape metrics for user-defined zones. Such zones can be defined through regular units (e.g. hexagons, grids) that can be created within the toolbox. In addition, any polygonal set specified by the user (e.g. administrative units) can be used. The implemented set of landscape metrics is specifically selected and valid for calculations within zones. The tool is demonstrated based on a case study for the Warsaw metropolitan area and the possibilities of applying the toolbox for different zonal layers are illustrated. The implementation is based on the Python toolbox introduced in ArcGIS 10.1, offering an easy to use graphical user interface and batch calculation possibilities. The source code is free and open to the community and extendable to specific needs.

AB  - As the stormwater components of water sensitive urban design have gained traction in Australia, large numbers of stormwater control measures (SCMs) have been constructed. Examples of SCMs include trash racks, bioretention systems, and swales. SCMs must be appropriately managed if they are to function as designed. As a reasonably new asset class, management of SCMs around Australia is far from perfect. However, many local governments, and some private sector asset owners, have made considerable progress in developing processes and practices to manage and maintain their SCMs. They have done this by: (1) locating existing assets; (2) determining the condition of existing assets; (3) determining which department should be responsible for maintenance; (4) building a business case; (5) determining if on-ground work should be undertaken by contractors or in-house crews; (6) briefing upward to management; and (7) continually improving. Despite efforts to appropriately manage SCMs, large challenges exist. These will need to be addressed and SCM asset management will need to become mainstream if SCMs are to be appropriately managed. This chapter describes these challenges, operation and maintenance requirements, and a process to develop a mechanism for ongoing operation and maintenance of SCMs.

AB  - An accumulating body of research identifies the importance of landscape structure for a wide range of countryside interests. Landscape structure reflects the results of policies and practices, and is well-suited as a target for management actions. New landscape metrics represent a potential for indicator-based management, provided such metrics relate consistently to the landscape values of interest. In this paper we propose that aspects of landscape structure, specifically heterogeneity, may be related to landscape-based values such as biodiversity, cultural heritage and human appreciation. Birds and vascular plants correlated well with our index for the heterogeneity of land types, whereas insects did not. Occurrence of prehistoric graves was also associated with land type heterogeneity, though other types of cultural remains were not. Landscape experience seems to be associated with the heterogeneity of landscape space rather than heterogeneity of land types. Different aspects of heterogeneity, scale, and variation over time all contribute to explain how our measures of landscape-based values vary in their relationship to landscape heterogeneity. Successful integration between disciplines in landscape studies depends on having a common operational framework, a shared theoretical basis, and a harmonised approach to data collection.

AB  - Rapid qualitative field methods can be used to evaluate ecological integrity (EI) at a landscape level. This study evaluates the EI of 63 landscape types (LCTs) in Cyprus derived from Landscape Character Mapping. Following a stratified sampling, LCTs were evaluated using 209 Land Description Units (LDUs) i.e., homogeneous map entities, sharing a similar pattern of natural and cultural elements. In every LDU, six ecological integrity (EI) indicators were visually assessed consistently namely naturalness, habitat continuity, number of habitats, dominant habitat type, management intensity and scale. TwoStep Cluster Analysis was employed to identify EI categories, and Categorical Principal Components Analysis (CATPCA) to associate the individual indicators with overall EI in the LDUs. Linear regressions were used to predict EI based on the most important indicators. Forested and shrubland landscapes have consistently good EI with low variation, while urbanized and agricultural landscapes have lower EI. There is great variation in the number of agricultural landscape types and their EI. There are significant linear relationships between EI and naturalness, habitat continuity and intensity. The novelty of this work lies with the fact that it provides the first island-wide study in the Mediterranean assessing EI spatially through a small number of indicators. Results indicate that LCA can be an appropriate consistent and inexpensive spatial framework for assessing EI, which can be directly associated with management intervention to maintain or improve EI.

AB  - The need to implement effective incentive systems for a sustainable management of landscape requires policy makers and stakeholders to understand the monetary values that communities attach to landscape and its characteristics. The estimation of such monetary values has been challenging economists for the last decades because of the complexity of considering landscape components in economic models. To overcome this problem, we suggest a multidisciplinary approach that integrates landscape ecology, landscape preference studies and environmental economics to provide a common framework for collaboration between landscape scientists and economists. Within this approach, firstly a parametric landscape procedure is used to organize the spatial information on landscape by identifying landscape types and quantifying their attributes. Secondly, these indicators are used as explanatory variables in a Choice Experiment of individuals’ preferences for landscape, to assess the economic value that people attach to different landscape attributes. The economic values thus estimated are of particular interest to policy makers as they express the monetary benefits that society receives from landscape and its characteristics. Such values can then be used in cost benefit analyses for evaluating public programs affecting landscape and its features.

AB  - Urban ecosystems are the areas where built infrastructure covers a large proportion of the land surface but the main source of ecosystem services provision is the green infrastructure. This provision is very much dependent on the particular combination of green spaces such as parks or vegetation belts and paved areas such as buildings and streets. The spatial arrangement of these elements is an important parameter which could be used for the assessment of the ecosystem condition in the urban areas. An integrated index of spatial structure is proposed which incorporates built types and land cover from the Local Climate Zones (LCZ) concept with urban ecosystems' classes developed on the basis of MAES typology. An algorithm has been developed for index generation using an urban ecosystems' database and remote sensing data. The index is used to define vegetation cover in urban ecosystems and assess their condition as a part of the assessment framework. It is also applied in the assessment of several ecosystem services through quantification of ecosystem services' indicators or as an indicator in a complex assessment. The results show that, although most urban ecosystems in Bulgaria are assessed as moderate and good condition, very few of them have very good condition and about 3.5% have very bad condition. The highest scores are defined for urban green areas while the lowest are for transport networks. The use of an integrated index in urban ecosystem services' assessment is represented by examples for global and local climate regulation. The results are used to develop maps of ecosystem services supply capacity for selected cities. The overall analysis indicates that the urban ecosystems in Bulgaria have a moderate to good capacity for local climate regulation and moderate to low capacity for global climate regulation. The integrated index of spatial structure provides an appropriate basis for characterisation and assessment of the urban ecosystems condition and ecosystem services following the requirements of the EU Biodiversity Strategy and the MAES process. The proposed approach enables the internal heterogeneity of the urban ecosystems at national level to be defined, this being one of the main challenges in studying urban ecological systems.

AB  - This paper addresses the representation of landscape complexity in stated preferences research. It integrates landscape ecology and landscape economics and conducts the landscape analysis in a three-dimensional space to provide ecologically meaningful quantitative landscape indicators that are used as variables for the monetary valuation of landscape in a stated preferences study. Expected heterogeneity in taste intensity across respondents is addressed with a mixed logit model in willingness to pay space. Our methodology is applied to value, in monetary terms, the landscape of the Sorrento Peninsula in Italy, an area that has faced increasing pressure from urbanisation affecting its traditional horticultural, herbaceous, and arboreal structure, with loss of biodiversity, and an increasing risk of landslides. We find that residents of the Sorrento Peninsula would prefer landscapes characterised by large open views and natural features. Residents also appear to dislike increasing level of landscape heterogeneity and the presence of lemon orchards and farmers' stewardship, which are associated with the current failure of protecting the traditional landscape. The outcomes suggest that the use of landscape ecology metrics in a stated preferences model may be an effective way to move forward integrated methodologies to better understand and represent landscape and its complexity.

AB  - Cultural landscapes are valued for their landscape character and cultural heritage. Yet, these often low-intensity, multifunctional landscapes are at risk of disappearance. Understanding how cultural landscapes might change under alternative futures is important for identifying where to target actions towards persistence of cultural landscapes. This study therefore aims to identify past and future land use changes in the European Union’s (EU’s) cultural landscapes. To do so, we overlay past and projected plausible future land change trajectories with the spatial distribution of cultural landscapes in the EU. Our results highlight a clear co-occurrence of specific land change trajectories and cultural landscape types. Past and future urbanization and agricultural abandonment are the land use change processes most strongly affecting small-scale, low-intensity agricultural landscapes that are valued by society. De-intensification is overrepresented in landscapes with a low management intensity. Past intensification was overrepresented in small-scale landscapes with a high value to society, while future intensification might concentrate on landscapes with a low intensity. Typical cultural landscapes show a strong variation of changes under different scenario conditions in terms of future landscape change. Scenario analysis revealed that some of the threats to cultural landscapes are related to agricultural policies, nature policies and other spatial restrictions. At the same time, these policies may also alleviate these threats when properly designed and targeted by accounting for the impacts they may have on cultural landscapes. Considering cultural landscapes more directly in decisions to be made for the post-2020 Common Agricultural Policy period is needed, and could be achieved by a focus on landscape quality beyond the current focus on specific greening measures.

AB  - Rural historical studies have revolved around the historical evolution of the landscape, the nature of change in rural landscapes and societies, and the role of continuity in the emergence of modern ruralities. The earliest and most enduring approach was concerned with the ‘making of the rural’, focusing on pattern and process in the evolution of settlement, the roles of continuity, change and modernization, and the impact of geographical inertia in rural landscapes. A more recent approach reflecting broader changes in cultural geography focuses on the ‘meaning of the rural’ and its representation in narratives of innocent change and transformation of natures and societies. Rural historical geographies have been dominated by a Eurocentric discourse in which European rural society and environment have been the benchmarks for historical studies in other parts of the world. The historiography of rural historical geography mirrors these changes in approach. Earlier preoccupations with land reclamation of wilderness for agriculture; colonization of lowlands and forest; settlement structures and patterns; field systems, estates, land reform and modernization of landscape have given way to a reassessment of the roles of native and colonial subalterns in resistance to regulation and transformation of their landscapes and ecological destruction of environments and cultural landscapes.

Several forms of ramification alterations have been described in central and northern European species (Norway spruce, beech, Durmast oak, English oak, birch). This study examines the situation in Tuscany and offers a description of the alterations found in the main species typical of the Mediterranean region (Turkey oak, pubescent oak, holm oak, stone pine). The article discusses the potential impact of these alterations on the most typical forest formations, the ones which characterize the Tuscan landscape, and it describes the modifications already under way.

AB  - Information about cultural landscape settings and characteristics is essential for understanding and finding solutions for their sustainable management. In the Gurage socio-ecological production landscape of Ethiopia, “Jefoure” refers to a traditional grass-covered road with households on either side. This study aims to map and characterize Jefoure roads to help manage them sustainably. Data were compiled using survey tools and recent orthophoto images and then were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. The results underscore Jefoure as a network of roads of variable lengths that can be as extensive as 87 m. Notably, the physical geography of the landscape has an impact on the length, shape, and directions of these roads. Jefoure roads are multifunctional roads that have been designed and managed by local people for centuries. The Gurage settlement pattern is centered on these roads, which influences their home garden functional spaces. Residents, local groups, land-use planners, and decision-makers need to manage the cultural roads sustainably. This study generates valuable empirical information regarding a Gurage landscape feature that is not common knowledge, and it can support decision-makers and other conservation initiatives aimed at the sustainable management. It may also inform and encourage other researchers in their studies on similar cultural roads. This road has a cultural value and needs to work on its heritagization, in conjunction with the community's various cultural assets.

AB  - This paper presents the conceptual design and application of a new land-change modelling framework that represents geographical, sociological, economic, and ecological aspects of a land system. The framework provides an overarching design that can be extended into specific model implementations to evaluate how policy, land-management preferences, and land-market dynamics affect (and are affected by) land-use and land-cover change patterns and subsequent carbon storage and flux. To demonstrate the framework, we implement a simple integration of a new agent-based model of exurban residential development and land-management decisions with the ecosystem process model BIOME-BGC. Using a stylized scenario, we evaluate the influence of different exurban residential-land-management strategies on carbon storage at the parcel level over a 48-year period from 1958 to 2005, simulating stocks of carbon in soil, litter, vegetation, and net primary productivity. Results show 1) residential parcels with management practices that only provided additions in the form of fertilizer and irrigation to turfgrass stored slightly more carbon than parcels that did not include management practices, 2) conducting no land-management strategy stored more carbon than implementing a strategy that included removals in the form of removing coarse woody debris from dense tree cover and litter from turfgrass, and 3) the removal practices modelled had a larger impact on total parcel carbon storage than our modelled additions. The degree of variation within the evaluated land-management practices was approximately 42,104 kg C storage on a 1.62 ha plot after 48 years, demonstrating the substantial effect that residential land-management practices can have on carbon storage.

AB  - In this study, the potential of machine learning (ML) for shallow groundwater level predictions in urban areas is explored. It focuses on curating a training dataset that represents the spatial variability of the water table depth, tests the effect of using different feature variables in ML modeling, and finally, compares two ML models with a physically-based (PB) urban hydrological model. To curate a consistent training dataset, a method of transferring low-frequency groundwater level measurements to a minimum water table depth (MWTD) was developed. Two ML models, one with national maps as feature variables and the other including local high-resolution urban feature variables, were trained against the same 280 groundwater level data points and applied to predict the MWTD at a 10 m spatial resolution for the city of Odense, Denmark. The ML models reached a similar fit to the observations, with an RMSE of 1.1 m and 1.3 m, respectively, and outperformed the urban PB model. In densely urbanized areas, the ML models and the PB model showed up to a 1.5 m difference in predictions of MWTD. The results suggest that ML modeling has the potential to provide spatially high-resolution predictions of the shallow groundwater table in urban areas, which represents a challenge for PB models because of their model structure and the lack of hydrological knowledge hindering meaningful parameterization schemes. Furthermore, a SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis of the feature variables illustrates that ML models can be utilized to explore the hydrological relations in urban domains, by analyzing the feature variables’ relations.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbance acts globally as an ecological process with long-term implication on the ecosystem equilibrium. In the central-western Argentina (Desierto del Monte Central: DMC), the desert Prosopis flexuosa woodlands has been intervened by man with differential incidence, e.g. through logging, fire and grazing. Despite recognizing a history of disturbances in these forests, the local removal of trees and its incidence in the stem growth of the surviving trees is still poorly known. Dendroecological methods were applied to 10 plots distributed along a landform gradient, aiming to analyze how disturbance, together with possible modulation effects of the spatial variability on growth, can influence forest dynamics. Tree removal was an intensive practice during the second half of the 20th century in the DCM, in synchrony with the expansion of wine-growing activity. Our results suggest that removal of P. flexuosa individuals in any considered plot was the main driver of changes in the forest dynamics. This argument is based on the weak climatic incidence in years considered critical with respect to the beginning of abrupt tree-growth releases. This disturbance impact seemed to be landform-dependent, as suggested by the higher relative basal area values at mesic sites in relation to sites linked to drier landforms. The presented findings represent the first attempt in reconstructing the disturbance regime experienced by the DMC P. flexuosa woodlands. Our research contributes to interpret how logging practices coupled with landform-related heterogeneities may influence the forest dynamics at desert environments, providing elements for implementing policies for conservation and management of these natural resources.

AB  - Research for a concept of sustainable agriculture and for the sustainable use of agricultural landscapes are closely related to the development of an international acknowledged indicator framework for the analysis and valuation of the environmental situation by the OECD. Worldwide efforts are focussing on this new topic in the environmental discussion: quantifying and valuation of impacts of agricultural practice on the animated and unanimated environment to draw conclusions for agricultural policy. A key function holds the term sustainability, which is assumed to dominate future policy approaches. The growing insecurity about the environmental impacts of agricultural land use systems led to the overall goal to avoid irreversible damages by agriculture. The development of tools for decision-makers on all decision levels are to:1.recognise and value impacts degrading the environment;2.assess future sources of danger;3.develop sustainable land use systems. Decision supporting tools are worked out since few years for diverse purposes. As a term reflecting the most relevant environmental aspects on the global level agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) are in the focus of interest. Latest since the [Environmental Indicators for Agriculture, vol. 1: Concepts and Framework. Publications Service, OECD, Paris, 1997] launched the driving force-state-response (DSR) model and a catalogue with 14 AUI areas, which resulted from international discussions started on the Rio Conference in 1992, the political significance of an environmental measuring system was recognised. One of the focal points was the indicator issue concerning landscapes and to define indicators which are capable to describe landscapes. Actual indicator concepts for landscape of the OECD, the EU and the PAIS research project illustrate the efforts to integrate landscapes in agricultural policies.

The discussion has implications for the potential of rooftop greening, a new but increasingly common addition of open space in today's growing urban areas. With the continuing trend towards urbanization and taller buildings, rooftop spaces stand to offer residents doorstep green oasis in the skyline of high-rise buildings.

AB  - Multimetric index (MMI) approach is a broadly used in ecological assessment because it can integrate information of various kinds of ecologically related metrics of freshwater ecosystems and provide an easily understandable score for purpose of further evaluation and managements. Accounting for natural variation and disentangling covariation between natural environmental factors and human disturbance factors are imperative for an accurate assessment. Lots of progress has been made recently on the aforementioned two aspects. Three approaches, a priori classification of sites by regions or typologies, site-specific modeling of expected reference condition and varying metrics in site groups, have been tested in lakes and streams to improve assessment accuracy. All existed studies support that site-specific modeling can efficiently account for natural variation and generate a MMI with good performance. However, until now, no strong evidence has shown that diatom/blue-algae typologies are better than regionalization frameworks on accounting for natural variation either in lakes or in streams. To separate the natural variation explained by site specific modeling from that of varying metrics is necessary for a thorough and accurate evaluation on the valuableness of site-grouping by typologies. Different performance of varying metrics among site groups of streams and lakes was most probably caused by the lack of representativeness of diatom metrics on biological condition rather than the complex multi-stressor gradients in streams and rivers. A recent study showed that blue-green algae enhanced performance of diatom-based MMI on defining lake condition under high level of human disturbance. On the other hand, with more and more extensive and intensive use of statistics techniques in developing MMI, we also discussed some statistical challenges faced by scientists in field of ecological assessment, especially on setting significance level of a statistical test and multiple comparison issue in MMI performance comparison.

AB  - The contributions of plants and trees towards improving thermal comfort are important in tropical countries where they are exposed to high levels of solar radiation. In urban high-rise settings, the incorporation of landscaping is crucial in providing a green space that helps to improve the microclimate and to ensure the psychological well-being of its users. This paper examines the similarities and differences in the amount of filtered radiation among different tropical plant species in three different locations within a building, indicating the suitability of plants in a high-rise setting. The fieldwork measurement was conducted on 8 ornamental plant species in three different landscape areas of a 21-story office high-rise building in Penang, Malaysia. The radiation filtered underneath the plants and its Leaf Area Index (LAI) were measured. The study examined the relationship between the LAI of each existing plant species and the amount of solar radiation filtered by the plant’s canopy. An ANOVA partial F-test was used in this study to indicate the amount of solar radiation filtered by each plant species at a given LAI and its transmissivity value in each of the landscaped gardens. The results showed that the radiation filtration effect is highly dependent on the LAI. Other contributing factors, such as branching density and branching pattern, that affect the radiation absorbed by the plants were also observed. However, appropriate species selection needs to be considered before planting in a place with high wind velocity and a high amount of sun exposure.

AB  - Coastal regions are complex social-ecological systems (SESs) critically important for their diverse and invaluable services for human well-being. The marked losses of these systems on a global scale has led to proposals for the protection of healthy habitats which, however, have proven to be less than completely successful, thereby necessitating the restoration of impacted habitats. Although the effective delivery of restored ecosystem services or natural capital is determined by governance and management, these important topics have only rarely been examined (and never comparatively so) in the marine literature. Because marine ecological restoration is still very much in its infancy, it is necessary to turn to terrestrial examples for guidance. The present paper reviews the wider, terrestrially-based literature that has developed on the conceptual and practical relationships of governance to ecological restoration, towards an end of importing five lessons from this experience that might prove useful for the sustainable management of marine SESs, particularly in relation to the praxis of marine social-ecological restoration. These lessons are: avoid science/engineering only; instill adaptive management; hybrid governance models work best; establish an experienced advisory committee; and put stakeholders front and centre. Recommended actions needed to adopt these lessons include: assessing the cultural modification of the restoration location; including a social scientist on the restoration team; identifying multiple stakeholders; integrating technical knowledge of experts and local wisdom of residents; and implementing flexibility in governance to facilitate project resilience.

AB  - The paper proposes that landscape quality assessment may be approached on the basis of two contrasting paradigms, one which regards quality as inherent in the physical landscape, and the other which regards quality as a product of the mind – eye of the beholder. These are termed, respectively, the objectivist and subjectivist paradigms. These paradigms underlie the surveys of the physical landscape and studies of observer preferences. Examination of these paradigms through the approaches taken by philosophers from Plato to modern times demonstrates the ubiquity of the paradigms in underlying human perception of landscape. Until recent centuries, the objectivist paradigm provided philosophers with the basis for understanding beauty, including landscape beauty. However, the philosophers Locke, Hume, Burke and particularly Immanuel Kant identified beauty as lying in the eyes of the beholder rather than in the object. The parallels between Kant's aesthetic philosophy and contemporary theories of landscape quality based on an evolutionary perspective are examined. Most philosophers over recent centuries have adopted the subjectivist view of aesthetics. The paper concludes by proposing that only the subjectivist model should be used in research of landscape quality.

AB  - Stated preference studies are increasingly employed to estimate the value of attributes of European agrarian landscapes and changes therein. Despite the vast amount of case studies, preferences for landscape attributes are context specific, which inhibits cross-case comparison and up-scaling. In this study, we address this problem by applying a meta-analysis of stated preference studies that focus on attributes of European agrarian landscapes (n=345). The main objective of this study is to identify generic preferences for particular types of landscape attributes across case studies. In addition, landscape context variables that explain preference heterogeneity between different cases that address similar landscape attributes are identified. We find that landscape attributes that describe mosaic land cover, historic buildings or the presence of livestock generally receive the highest stated preferences across cases. Furthermore, we find relations between preferences for particular attributes and context variables – such as population density and GDP per capita – using a meta-regression analysis. The results of the present study provide the first cross-disciplinary and cross-case evidence on relations between preferences for landscape attributes and socio-economic and landscape context conditions. The study is a first step toward up-scaling of landscape preferences and the development social landscape indicators that reflect the perceived value of landscapes at regional and pan-regional scales, which is increasingly important as landscape policies are progressively implemented at European level.

AB  - This study answers the following research questions: 1) What are the change trajectories of woody vegetation elements at the landscape level? 2) What are the differences in change trajectories amongst the various categories of forest, non-forest and reclamation woody vegetation? 3) How do the change trajectories differ in mining and non-mining landscapes? The study area, measuring 209.6 km2, is located in the north-western part of the Czech Republic and may be broken down into 76.8 km2 of mining landscape and 132.8 km2 of non-mining landscape. Brown coal mining began in this region during the second half of the 18th century and led to the radical transformation of the landscape, including woodlands, during the second half of the 20th century. The source data for this study was obtained from the original stable cadastre maps (1842) and the landscape field mapping performed in 2010. The various woody vegetation elements (forest, non-forest, and reclamation woody plants) and land use/cover (LULC) categories were identified. The GIS symmetrical difference tool was subsequently used to perform an overlay analysis for the individual woody vegetation elements in order to study the change trajectories and to obtain information about the woodlands that have remained unchanged (continuous), the ones that have disappeared (extinct), and the ones that have newly appeared in the landscape (recent). In the case of the non-mining landscape, the total proportion of woodlands has increased (from 17 to 32%), but there has been a decline in the overall volume of forest woody plants found in these areas (from 93 to 74%). As far as the mining landscape is concerned, there has also been an increase in the area covered by woodlands (from 10 to 20%), however, the proportion of forest woody plants has decreased to a much greater extent (from 90 to 31%). From the perspective of extinct woody vegetation, 23.3% of all types of woodlands in the mining landscape may be classified as such, as compared to 10.8% in the non-mining landscape. The primary causes of this decline are mining activities and newly built-up areas. More continuous woody vegetation may be found in the non-mining landscape (42.1%) as compared to the mining landscape (15.4%). Recent woody vegetation, which has primarily replaced grasslands and partially arable land, prevails in both the mining (61.3%) as well as the non-mining (47.1%) landscapes. Different categories of woodlands (forest, non-forest, and reclamation woody vegetation elements) exhibit various change dynamics due to their different structure and the functions they serve. At the most basic level, there has been an overall increase in the occurrence of woodlands in the studied areas. However, once GIS spatial analysis is applied it is possible to see more complex processes in the development of woodland areas as characterised by gains and losses, and it is possible to identify mining and agricultural extensification as the two most significant factors behind the historical changes. Mining leads to a direct decrease in the area of woodlands; conversely, the spontaneous succession of vegetation resulting from agricultural extensification and forest reclamation facilitates woodland recovery. Forest reclamation and reforestation are essential on order to ensure the time continuity of woodlands in both types of landscape, i.e. mining and non-mining. The study presented in this paper proves that it is relevant to analyse the changes occurring in different woodland categories separately. The same methodology may be applied when studying the change dynamics of other important landscape elements, such as wood pastures and wetlands.

AB  - The present study evaluated the role of having plants at home during the confinement period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that deprived people of freely visiting open green spaces. Preferences concerning the quantity of the desired vegetation as well as the ways in which the COVID-19 crisis affected the change of perceptions with regard to having plants at home were also evaluated. A questionnaire, which was filled by 4205 participants, provided an undistracted evaluation of the impact of indoor and outdoor plants on their emotional welfare considering behavioural, social, and demographic variables. The emotional state of the respondents was neutral and a significant proportion expressed positive emotions. Having indoor plants was correlated with more positive emotions, and confined inhabitants allocated more time for plant maintenance. By contrast, negative emotions prevailed in respondents who related to a positive COVID-19 case, which was more frequent in females and young participants living in small houses that received low levels of natural light and had few or no plants. A few indoor plants placed in strategic positions were also preferred compared with a high number of plants. By contrast, an increased amount of vegetation accompanied by living walls was preferred for outdoor settings. Living walls were considered as advantageous for increasing indoor vegetation, but they were also associated with technical and economical hurdles.

It presents the entire path of indicator development for the evaluation of ES potentials in the postglacial landscape. Altogether, 29 ecosystem services were assessed by means of 35 indicators. Services are arranged firstly according to the type of assessment (expert/social), and then follow CICES V5.1 classification and coding. In expert assessment provisioning and regulating services were taken into account while cultural services were evaluated through social assessment. All subchapters devoted to particular services comprise: ES description (a table with ES location in CICES V5.1, indicator metadata, and briefly mentioned data sources), theoretical framework, assessment method and indicator values. Each subchapter ends with a map showing ES potential in the study area. Additionally, all services assessed for ecosystems in the narrow sense have their spatial pattern described by means of landscape metrics.

AB  - Flower gardens can create valuable habitat for urban pollinators, but little is known about the existing spatial pattern of gardens on the landscape, or factors associated with the decision to plant a flower garden. We mapped the distribution of front yard flower gardens compared to four other front yard landscaping types (lawn, shrubs, non-vegetated, and weeds) across 86,429 addresses in Greater Boston, MA, USA using Google Street View. We complemented these data with on-the-ground surveys at a stratified random subset of 519 yards. We hypothesized that census tracts with higher incomes would have higher flower garden frequencies and that these gardens would have higher species richness, and that census tracts with larger lots would also have higher flower garden frequencies and species richness. Yards identified as flower gardens using Google Street View contained around double the cultivated floral species richness of lawns and more than any other yard type. However, flower gardens were infrequent in front yards, and were a substantial front yard cover type in only 2.3 % of yards. Flower garden frequency and cultivated species richness were greater with higher census tract income, both consistent with the luxury effect hypothesis. However, higher-income lots also had more lawns and fewer spontaneous (weedy) species. Surprisingly, flower gardens had higher frequencies in census tracts with smaller lots. In our region, flower gardening appears to be constrained by income or education but not lot size, pointing to the potential role of small urban lots as a target for pollinator habitat.

AB  - The Nature Conservancy (TNC—USA) has developed an efficient system for inventory and evaluation of ‘elements-of-diversity’. The major components of this system are a ‘fine filter’ for species inventory and a ‘coarse filter’ for community-type inventory. As in traditional vegetation science, community sampling and classification are restricted to relatively homogeneous stands and avoid edges, ecotones, and disturbed areas. TNC employs a habitat-based system of natural communities to complement plant community classification. This system is used to identify stands that cumulatively encompass the full range of variation within each defined natural community type. Ecological relationships among community-types in real landscapes, however, are not accounted for. This paper reviews some important ecological functions of heterogeneous landscapes, which are not necessarily protected by conservation strategies that focus on separate, homogeneous community-types. Recommendations to expand TNC's coarse filter to landscapes include: (1) Disturbance regime and regeneration patterns should be evaluated for each major community-type, and for each site representing a type or group of types; (2) Functional combinations of community-types and developmental stages (landscape mosaics) should be addressed in the TNC system; (3) Landscape context (e.g., surrounding habitat types and connectivity) for a site is as important as the habitat content (e.g., the rarity or quality of community-types present). Attention to landscape-level patterns and processes will be helful for evaluating large sites that are composed of many community-types, and in setting selection and stewardship priorities for sites for any size that are surrounded by dissimilar habitat.

AB  - Nowadays, dealing with organic waste (or biowaste) remains a global phenomenon. Especially developing countries worldwide generate more than 50 percent organicwaste. In the European Union (EU) with a share of 34%, biowaste is a dominantfraction of the municipal waste (EEA, 2020). Therefore, separate collection at source and environmentally sound treatment of biowaste are of key importance. An intensive optimisation of biowaste separate collection is needed to balance demands of municipal representatives and households’ needs. Based on the mixed-method approach we developed a MCDA model complemented by expert-based weighting assessment and combined with the GIS localisation tools aimed at the optimisation of biowaste container locations that reflects various spatial conditions, preconditions for the localisation of containers and its cost intensity. We concluded that changing the density of containers, distance between the address point and container, and selecting container locations that respect the habits of households and demands of the collection technology significantly affect the total and collection costs. We confirmed that the decreases in the total costs were not significant for maximum walking distances of over 95 m, and would approach zero for distances of over 230 m. When the maximum walking distance exceeds 268 m, 40% of all inhabitants would not participate in the system as it would be inconvenient for them. A recycling campaign is needed to increase their willingness to participate in the system. We provided arguments for decision-makers how to balance convenience of the biowaste separation system and collection costs by proper localisation of biowaste containers.

AB  - Balinese architecture was established prior to European colonization and significantly enhances traditional Balinese values that are woven into the predominant Hindu religion. Palaces are integral to the architectural heritage of Bali and were dated back to the Majapahit Empire. Balinese palaceswere constructed for non-ritualistic activities in this historical cultural landscape. Palaces were often located on road corners called catuspatha1andthey possess sacred values embodied in the concept of pempatanagung.Although Bali Province is today governed as one governance unit, these palaces still reflect their own multiple regal associations which arestill respected by Balinese society. The representations and architecture of these palaces andthe communicative symbols of a heyday era of Bali are raising questions as to how they can be accommodated within the over-arching tourism development and globalization of culture that Bali is experiencing. Therefore, this paper reviews pre-colonial Balinese palaces, their architecture, the catuspatha concept, and considers the traditional values of these ancient monuments as to conservation of palaces and their associated cultural heritage. An extensive literature review, surveys and observational inventories were undertaken at several palaces to obtain results that raise new questions about how these complexes can withstand globalization challenges whilst respecting traditional Balinese culture and society.

AB  - This study has been set up to analyse the interaction between agriculture and landscape in Europe. Landscapes are in a process of transformation owing to current changes in farming practice in the European Community. This will bring about a considerable amount of instability to the countryside. In most of Europe farming is still related to soil conditions, topography and climate. In view of the existing lack of a common terminology required for a description of—and the distinction between—European landscapes the authors set up their own topology. Thirteen types of European (agricultural) landscapes are distinguished. Each one of these is named and also illustrated by means of a pictorial representation. An analysis of trends in agriculture and of possible government policies is the basis for the presentation of four scenarios describing alternative developments of the European landscape. These scenarios emphasize in turn four divergent policies in the Common Market. The impact on the landscape in each case is illustrated on four maps of Europe. The first scenario is based on an emphasis on a liberal price and market policy resulting in a tremendous change in mobility, in concentration of production, with a markedly negative impact on environmental quality and landscape amenity. The second scenario emphasizes the promotion of existing qualities in regions with a strong identity, both in terms of special products and in environmental characteristics. The third scenario stresses the need for a protection and preservation of natural and cultural values in the landscape. This means restrictions in production and the large-scale subvention of farmers. The fourth scenario is based on giving priority to an improvement of environmental quality by means of an active intervention. The sustainability of natural resources comes first here. The measures and instruments needed to implement these four scenarios are described, and so is the impact of each of them on the landscapes of Europe. The discussion leads to the conclusion that the four scenarios may be applicable simultaneously in various areas of Europe, also depending on regional conditions.

AB  - Road verge gardening is a civic greening practice undertaken by residents, which can contribute to the quantity, diversity and structural complexity of the greenery within the road easement. By understanding the social drivers of verge gardening, we can potentially increase biodiversity, ecosystem function and human amenity. We surveyed residents of single occupancy dwellings in Melbourne, Australia, and recorded demographic data and beliefs regarding road verge gardening. We used structural equation modelling to test causal models of cognitive constructs underlying verge gardening. We identified cultural background, gardening enthusiasm and level of education as significant factors differentiating respondents who planted verge understorey, planted street trees or did not verge garden. Normative beliefs were the main cognitive construct affecting resident behaviour, with those who did not verge garden more likely to think that others – and in particular municipal authorities – would disapprove of them verge gardening compared to residents who did verge garden. Sense of community, beliefs regarding the benefits of verge gardening, and feelings for nature had significant, but less direct, effects. Changing normative beliefs is a significant pathway to promoting verge gardening. Municipal authorities could reorient policy to encourage verge gardening and increase plantings in the verges they maintain. Planners and urban designers may wish to develop policy to better incorporate verge gardening into urban greening strategies.

AB  - Summary
The validity of load estimates from intermittent, instantaneous grab sampling is dependent on adequate spatial coverage by monitoring networks and a sampling frequency that reflects the variability in the system under study. Catchments with a flashy hydrology due to surface runoff pose a particular challenge as intense short duration rainfall events may account for a significant portion of the total diffuse transfer of pollution from soil to water in any hydrological year. This can also be exacerbated by the presence of strong background pollution signals from point sources during low flows. In this paper, a range of sampling methodologies and load estimation techniques are applied to phosphorus data from such a surface water dominated river system, instrumented at three sub-catchments (ranging from 3 to 5km2 in area) with near-continuous monitoring stations. Systematic and Monte Carlo approaches were applied to simulate grab sampling using multiple strategies and to calculate an estimated load, Le based on established load estimation methods. Comparison with the actual load, Lt, revealed significant average underestimation, of up to 60%, and high variability for all feasible sampling approaches. Further analysis of the time series provides an insight into these observations; revealing peak frequencies and power-law scaling in the distributions of P concentration, discharge and load associated with surface runoff and background transfers. Results indicate that only near-continuous monitoring that reflects the rapid temporal changes in these river systems is adequate for comparative monitoring and evaluation purposes. While the implications of this analysis may be more tenable to small scale flashy systems, this represents an appropriate scale in terms of evaluating catchment mitigation strategies such as agri-environmental policies for managing diffuse P transfers in complex landscapes.

AB  - For the medieval County of Flanders, research by Adriaan Verhulst has indicated the importance of planted row settlements for intensified systematic landscape reclamations. Despite his influential studies and a long research history, little is known about the spatial distribution of this settlement morphology and its relation to the physical landscape in the former county. Moreover, the highly build up character of modern-day Flanders makes it difficult to discern remnants of the medieval settlement systems in the landscapes today. In this study, a multidisciplinary integration of historical and geographical data in GIS allows a first determination of the geographical and temporal distribution of these row settlements at the landscape level. Following the mapping and dating of the pre-industrial row settlements, a spatial analysis allows to study its distribution pattern through time in relation to the main soil textures in the county.

AB  - Residential landscapes support human well-being and ecological functioning in urban ecosystems. Trees and native plants in yards and neighborhoods positively influence satisfaction, an important component of human well-being and quality of life. However, these patterns may not hold true in arid ecoregions, where the composition of desert vegetation contrasts the tall, broad-leafed trees of temperate regions. The effects of xeric, desert-like landscaping on satisfaction with the neighborhood environment are especially important to consider given the large amount of resources required to support people’s propensity for grassy yards. Although place satisfaction is related to pro-environmental behavior, the multi-scalar relationship between yard management decisions and satisfaction with the neighborhood environment has yet to be established. Here, we test the social-ecological dynamics of landscape preferences, satisfaction with trees and desert plants, and management intensity in residential yards and neighborhoods throughout the desert city of Phoenix, Arizona, USA. We found that wealthy neighborhoods close to desert open space were intensively managed and supported the highest levels of satisfaction. However, there was no direct relationship between satisfaction and management intensity for people who preferred xeric landscaping. Instead, management intensity for people with xeric preferences was related to demographics, such as income and home ownership. There was a relationship between satisfaction and management intensity for people with mesic preferences, suggesting a resource cost to maintain satisfaction for lush, green landscaping in a desert city. Overall, our study supports the assertion that changing yard landscaping may not result in desired changes for high-input management practices.

AB  - Environmental modifications are leading to biodiversity changes, loss and habitat disturbance. This in turn increases contacts between wildlife and hence the risk of transmission and emergence of zoonotic diseases. We analyzed the environment and land use using remote spatial data around the sampling locations of bats positive for coronavirus (21 sites) and astrovirus (11 sites) collected in 43 sites. A clear association between viruses and hosts was observed. Viruses associated to synanthropic bat genera, such as Myotis or Scotophilus were associated to highly transformed habitats with human presence while viruses associated to fruit bat genera were correlated with natural environments with dense forest, grassland areas and regions of high elevation. In particular, group C betacoronavirus were associated with mosaic habitats found in anthropized environments.

AB  - Clearly defined protection goals specifying what to protect, where and when, are required for designing scientifically sound risk assessments and effective risk management of chemicals. Environmental protection goals specified in EU legislation are defined in general terms, resulting in uncertainty in how to achieve them. In 2010, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a framework to identify more specific protection goals based on ecosystem services potentially affected by plant protection products. But how applicable is this framework to chemicals with different emission scenarios and receptor ecosystems? Four case studies used to address this question were: (i) oil refinery waste water exposure in estuarine environments; (ii) oil dispersant exposure in aquatic environments; (iii) down the drain chemicals exposure in a wide range of ecosystems (terrestrial and aquatic); (iv) persistent organic pollutant exposure in remote (pristine) Arctic environments. A four-step process was followed to identify ecosystems and services potentially impacted by chemical emissions and to define specific protection goals. Case studies demonstrated that, in principle, the ecosystem services concept and the EFSA framework can be applied to derive specific protection goals for a broad range of chemical exposure scenarios. By identifying key habitats and ecosystem services of concern, the approach offers the potential for greater spatial and temporal resolution, together with increased environmental relevance, in chemical risk assessments. With modifications including improved clarity on terminology/definitions and further development/refinement of the key concepts, we believe the principles of the EFSA framework could provide a methodical approach to the identification and prioritization of ecosystems, ecosystem services and the service providing units that are most at risk from chemical exposure.

AB  - This paper attempts to examine the effect of sea view to room rates alongside other structural and locational attributes. Specifically, it aims to test whether rooms with a sea view are priced higher than others, thus trying to quantify the associated aesthetic values of coastal areas where tourism-related development is a key economic activity. For this purpose, a sample of 557 rooms in Halkidiki, Greece was collected through an online database during the summer tourist season. Subsequently, these data were integrated into a GIS-system in order to apply a spatial hedonic model. A semi-parametric geographically weighted regression model was used to assess the local effects, as well as, to investigate the spatial variability of the selected attributes. The results exhibited a significant spatial variability concerning the effect of sea view to room rates, indicating that local natural and/or tourism resources may have a substantial role in aesthetic values.

AB  - This work’s aim is to evaluate the importance of landscape in wine quality perception using a novel integrated approach based on two statistical techniques, i.e. choice-based conjoint analysis (Gustafsson et al., 2001) and combination-based permutation tests (Corain and Salmaso, 2004, Pesarin and Salmaso, 2009a). To this end we developed a preference choice experiment which was submitted to a sample of respondents during blind wine tasting meetings. The obtained results allow us to weigh up and emphasise the importance of an attractive landscape to the perception of a finer quality of wine. Indeed, we noticed that associating wine to an image of greater visual impact, i.e. an evocative landscape, induces a significantly higher preference for the tasted wine. Moreover, the integrated application of choice-based conjoint analysis and combination-based permutation tests allows us to identify the specific relationship each market segment has with landscape, price and wine quality.

They promise to make cities more resilient and adapt to mounting heat, flood, and migration pressures. The great threat of climate change, hunger, thirst, and societal disintegration can meet a direct response in the most vulnerable centers of human civilization: cities. The case for strengthening urban agriculture and nurturing resilient regional food systems is stark and powerful, as a community affirming organizational process, a communal cultural practice, a corporate commitment to sustainable endogenous food sources, and an innovational driver. This volume presents a salient, current, and urgent set of instructions, from the simple to the complex, from the low tech to the software driven and fully automated, featuring a wide range of useful contributions from many parts of the world.

AB  - The concept of ecosystem services is increasingly important for measuring both tangible and intangible benefits that humans obtain from ecosystems. Much research on ecosystem services focused on more tangible services. Intangible cultural ecosystem services, such as sense of place, are often neglected, but in the context of highly populated, increasingly urbanized countries, maintenance of cultural ecosystem services is an important policy objective. One of the challenges of integrating sense of place into the framework of ecosystem services is that it is not linked to abstract notions of ecosystems, but tied to perceived landscape features such as mountains, or rivers. In this study, we used free listings and interviews with visitors to investigate perceived landscape features and sense of place through the lens of language in five different landscape types in Switzerland. Within each landscape type, we selected two study sites to quantitatively and qualitatively compare landscape descriptions. Using text processing, we show that terms for landscape features were more similar within the same landscape type, suggesting that people perceive differences between these landscapes that they express in language. However, in general, elicited concepts related to sense of place were similar across landscape types. Thus, our results show that we can use free-listing descriptions to distinguish landscape types, but we found limited differences in the language used to describe sense of place. Our findings offer insights into exploring sense of place in different landscapes and contribute to ongoing efforts for refining the definitions and standardizing assessments of cultural ecosystem services.

The adopted methodology focuses on the total viewshed concept, as a basic metric to assess visual properties. Four different Sardinian sub regions (Sinis, Siniscola, Marmilla, and Dorgali) and their nuraghi have been considered into the analysis, representing a significant – albeit partial – sample of the variability in locational choices found across the island. Results highlight a widespread interest in visibility from and to nuraghi, with the exception of the Sinis Peninsula, where nuraghi do not seem to act as landmarks. Moreover, no significant differences in visibility have been found between simple and complex nuraghi, while visibility data for nuraccheddus (generally considered to be unfinished nuraghi towers) seems to be compatible with a marginal landscape-level role.

AB  - In some western cultures, landscape practitioners are adapting the design, management and maintenance of urban parks in response to climate change and other pressures. The aim is to provide more robust and resilient solutions that expand the contribution of parks to ecosystem service delivery and give greater economic efficiency. However, urban parks in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia are still maintained, through traditional ‘high-intensity’ horticulture, which consumes significant resources and imposes a growing financial burden on the City. This paper draws on data from interviews with urban park management teams across different tiers from selected urban parks in Kuala Lumpur. Through photo simulation of alternative design and management regimes it investigates their response to a more environmentally sustainable approach, which reduces intensive maintenance and increases planting complexity. Results suggest that whilst there is an appetite for change, parks in tropical climates present different challenges to those in temperate climates where these ideas have typically been developed and applied. The seasonal change in the tropics between wet and dry seasons may be profound but is arguably less visually dramatic than temperate climates in terms of seasonal colour, changing visual permeability and amount of leaf litter. Increasing planting density and complexity in the tropics may also have unanticipated implications for personal safety when compared to temperate latitudes because of the consistent but much shorter seasonal daylight hours and absence of any extended twilight. This paper explores what appetite exists for park staff to move towards a more environmentally sensitive design approach. Attitudes are compared across different management levels, including those of ground staff who will be tasked with implementing this change and communicating it to the public directly. The data suggests that whilst there is some enthusiasm for more environmental approaches, especially amongst senior management, there are also significant reservations across all levels of park management.

AB  - The spatial structure, functionality and dynamics of forest landscapes in peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands were compared over the last five decades. Two particular features were studied in the sample sites: forest connectivity for wildlife and areas burnt by wildfires. 191 Squares, each 4km×4km, were selected from the SISPARES (the monitoring framework designed to evaluate the trends in the structure of Spanish rural landscapes) environmental strata. Aerial photographs from 1956, 1984, 1998 and 2008 were interpreted and 11 land cover categories mapped and checked in the field, using a minimum mapping area of one hectare. The Equivalent Connected Area Index was used to assess forest connectivity over the sampling period. Social and economical factors were assessed using indicators of farm intensiveness. The Spanish forest connectivity has improved in the last five decades although two different trends can be identified: the first 40 years are characterized by positive rates of growth whereas the 10 last years are characterized by their stability. Nevertheless the area of burnt land was higher along the first 25 studied years and decreased significantly over the last decade. Our results show the climate is the main driver in the evolution of forest connectivity and burnt area in the forest landscapes, playing a direct role on forest biomass production and wildfire ignition and propagation, as well as an indirect role by keeping vertical and horizontal forest continuity through the landscape spatial pattern. Social and economic factors are very important drivers as well: Rural population density and farm size average have been tested as good indicators of landscape artificiality, highly correlated to wildfire hazard and forest connectivity. Finally, we have pointed out the evolutionary path followed by SISPARES framework as a tool for monitoring rural landscapes. It emphasises on the requirement of a 30 years time window for building-up reliable dynamic multifunctional model.

Within this context, this paper examines the role landscape can play as a platform for Education for Sustainability. Understanding the term Education for Sustainability to be holistic, systemic, connective and ecological rather than content specific, the paper outlines the genesis of landscape as a formal learning environment, and then through case studies reviews the efficacy of landscape as an agent for an integrated pedagogy towards sustainable literacy.

AB  - Rural historical studies have revolved around the historical evolution of the landscape, the nature of change in rural landscapes and societies, and the role of continuity in the emergence of modern ruralities. The earliest and most enduring approach was concerned with the “making of the rural,” focusing on pattern and process in the evolution of settlement, the roles of continuity, change and modernization, and the impact of geographical inertia in rural landscapes. A more recent approach reflecting broader changes in cultural geography focuses on the “meaning of the rural” and its representation in narratives of innocent change and transformation of natures and societies. Rural historical geographies have been dominated by a Eurocentric discourse in which European rural society and environment have been the benchmarks for historical studies in other parts of the world. The historiography of rural historical geography mirrors these changes in approach. Earlier preoccupations with land reclamation of wilderness for agriculture; colonization of lowlands and forest; settlement structures and patterns; field systems, estates, land reform, and modernization of landscape have given way to a reassessment of the roles of native and colonial subalterns in resistance to regulation and transformation of their landscapes and ecological destruction of environments and cultural landscapes.

AB  - A range of new spatial datasets classifying the European environment has been constructed over the last few years. These datasets share the common objective of dividing European environmental gradients into convenient units, within which objects and variables of interest have relatively homogeneous characteristics. The stratifications and typologies can be used as a basis for up-scaling, for stratified random sampling of ecological resources, for the representative selection of sites for studies across the continent and for the provision of frameworks for modeling exercises and reporting at the European scale. This paper provides an overview of five recent European stratifications and typologies, constructed for contrasting objectives, and differing in spatial and thematic detail. These datasets are: the Environmental Stratification (EnS), the European Landscape Classification (LANMAP), the Spatial Regional Reference Framework (SRRF), the Agri-Environmental Zonation (SEAMzones), and the Foresight Analysis for Rural Areas Of Europe (FARO-EU) Rural Typology. For each classification the objective, background, and construction of the dataset are described, followed by a discussion of its robustness. Finally, applications of each dataset are summarized. The five stratifications and typologies presented here give an overview of different research objectives for constructing such classifications. In addition they illustrate the most up to date methods for classifying the European environment, including their limitations and challenges. As such, they provide a sound basis for describing the factors affecting the robustness of such datasets. The latter is especially relevant, since there is likely to be further interest in European environmental assessment. In addition, advances in data availability and analysis techniques, will probably lead to the construction of other typologies in the future.

AB  - The present study investigated whether case-specific monitoring (CSM) would be an appropriate option to detect possible effects on butterflies during commercial cultivation of Bt-maize (Cry1Ab). The analysis of an existing dataset on butterfly communities in Switzerland allowed quantifying the variability in species richness and abundance of nine ecological groups of butterflies resulting from habitat features, agricultural field management, landscape features, regional farming characteristics, spatial variability and temporal fluctuations. The data set also enabled to estimate the sample size needed to detect potential effects of Bt-maize in a CSM programme within the determined variability. Fifteen of the 24 tested descriptors of environmental and farming context induced significant variability in butterfly species richness and abundance of generalist butterflies. In case regulatory authorities would request a CSM, a stratified sampling design considering habitat, landscape, and regional farming types would be essential to account for existing sources of variability. However, recording only the presence and abundance of butterfly species will not be sufficient to explain occurring changes and sampling of additional explaining variables is crucial. The analysis showed that CSM will at best detect large effects on ubiquitous butterflies, whilst the detection of small effects would need a considerable sampling effort. A sampling effort of 100 pairs of fields or field margins will only allow detecting changes exceeding 30% in species richness or abundance of the most abundant species. Rare butterfly species can hardly be monitored in CSM and causalities between changes in butterfly communities and the cultivation of Bt-maize will be difficult to determine due to the high variability of communities and the multitude of influencing environmental factors. CSM is thus unlikely to reduce remaining uncertainties on potential effects on butterflies during commercial cultivation of Bt-maize. Ultimately, potential effects might be evaluated more rigorously in pre-market risk assessment by studying hazard and exposure of sensitive butterfly stages to Bt-maize through experimental toxicity studies in the laboratory or in the greenhouse.

AB  - Urbanization is an ongoing global process that is influencing and shaping individual mental health and well-being. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current literature containing state-of-the-art neuroscientific and mobile technologies that have been used to investigate the mental health implications of urban environments. Searches for peer-reviewed primary research articles were conducted in PubMed and SCOPUS, returning 33,443 papers; 90 empirical articles published from 1981 to 2021 were included in the final synthesis. Central findings suggest virtual reality and mobile electroencephalography to be the most commonly used methods, and demanding mood, affect, and health phenomena or states to be the most common concepts of study in both physical built settings and natural urban spaces. Recommendations for both future practice and study noting particular opportunities for future methodological contributions are discussed.

AB  - Transportation infrastructures are directly responsible for killing billions of animals worldwide. Although the understanding about road impacts have recently increased, the impact of railroads on wildlife has received less attention. The current knowledge concerning the impacts of railroads focuses mainly on large mammals although amphibians might be affected. Our study aims to unravel temporal and spatial patterns of Rhinella toad fatalities on a Brazilian Amazonian railroad, to comprehend how toads are killed and to estimate the magnitude of toad fatalities. Data collection was carried out on foot on an 871-km stretch of the Estrada de Ferro Carajás from 2013 to 2017. We identified different potential causes for fatalities: being run over, desiccated or with barotrauma signs. We estimated a surprisingly high carcass persistence probability of about 38 days. After correcting for the bias from carcass detection and removal, we estimated that approximately 10,000 toads are killed per year (≈ 11 fatalities/km/year). A GLM model showed that toads were more likely to be killed in the dry to wet transition. We identified critical zones of fatalities and prioritized them according to their intensity. The highly critical segments encompass >10% of all fatalities although they cover only 1.5% of the railroad. Our study is the first one to address carcass detection and persistence on railroads and to unravel patterns of fatalities of an amphibian species in a tropical climate. A better understanding of the patterns of animal fatality on railroads is of fundamental importance to manage and mitigate this impact.

AB  - Social access to urban parks is an understudied phenomenon encompassing the interplay between the physical conditions of urban neighborhoods and green space with the socio-cultural and historical relationships urban residents have developed with these familiar places. Understanding social access can help inform planners and designers who would like to ensure that measures taken to increase investment in and proximity to urban green space also result in increasing use of that green space by neighboring community members – a key premise in achieving intended benefits such as improved health and well-being. This study uses selected ethnographic field methods supplemented with semi-structured interviews to advance the concept of social access. In-depth narratives are shared to demonstrate the nuanced ways in which urban residents construct meaning in nearby urban green space and how that influences their perception and use of these places. The paper outlines the key dimensions of social access – people, activities, novelty, and ability – as well as five underlying historical and socio-cultural narratives used to describe these dimensions. The thorough documentation of the complexity inherent in social access suggests increased attention from researchers, designers, and planners is warranted to a) expand notion of access to urban green space beyond proximity, such as incorporating programming and cultural identity and b) support efforts to use innovative community engagement strategies beyond traditional evaluative methods (e.g. visual preference) to capture the layers of perspective held by urban residents.

AB  - In response to the effects of climate change, many countries are realigning their energy systems to the principle of sustainability. An energy system change will lead to the development of substantial renewable energy infrastructure (mostly wind and photovoltaic) in landscapes with effects on perceived landscape quality and socio-political acceptance. Both direct perceptive effects of physical landscape structures and latent meanings associated with those structures potentially affect their acceptance. This work evaluates the role of landscape-technology fit (derived from place-technology fit) representing the extent to which alternatives within each of these two components “fit” together (e.g., does a given type of renewable energy infrastructure fit well within some landscapes but not others?). It also evaluates the role of latent meanings ascribed to landscapes and renewable energy infrastructure within that mentioned “fit” decision as well as the role of prior experience (exposure) to both. The study is based on a survey of Swiss citizens in a representative online panel (n = 1062). To estimate preferences for diverse renewable energy infrastructure scenarios across landscape types, a discrete choice model was implemented. Meanings ascribed to landscapes and renewable energy infrastructure were included in a second component of the survey. An innovative hybrid choice model approach facilitated integration of latent and observed variables in a hierarchy of predictors. Results show that most effects were statistically significant. Landscape-technology fit functioned as a moderator between choice attributes and preferences; in turn, it is predicted by landscape and renewable energy meanings, which are predicted by relevant prior experience (exposure).

AB  - Landscape monitoring is a rapidly developing approach in the field of environmental science and management. In order to develop a sound landscape monitoring programme, key theoretical concepts and study objectives should be clearly stipulated, and the specific objects to be monitored, as well as the criteria for selecting study areas, hierarchical levels, and techniques of data collection and analysis should be identified. This paper describes the development and implementation of the Estonian monitoring programme for agricultural landscapes, conventional approaches for landscape monitoring, and by neighbourhood analysis, assesses how landscape features are covered by different complementary monitoring data and how the current pattern of monitoring networks represents the landscape features. A spatially explicit method of network design for monitoring and sampling strategies combines stratified and multi-scale agricultural landscape monitoring and uses neighbourhood analysis characterised by the nearest neighbourhood index and Ripley's K-function. Data for landscape analysis are obtained from landscape monitoring (three sets) and other complementary environmental monitoring sets, such as biodiversity, forest, soil, and water monitoring (11 sets). It is shown that several monitoring sets follow an approach that aims to achieve national geographical coverage, representing various landscape types. Small sets having less than 50 stations are biased and the networks are not statistically significant. Proportional stratified sampling requires fewer sites for large homogenous inland landscape districts. The concept of agricultural landscape monitoring was tested in pilot areas. The chosen multi-scale object-based methods provide a good overview of the level of human pressure on different categories of agricultural land. Results of the monitoring showed that the species composition and abundance of bio-indicators was, to a great degree, determined by landscape structure. A systematic approach focused on landscape classes helps to integrate the monitoring set as a whole and to achieve a coherent and efficient layout of monitoring sets for Estonia.
