AB  - The ability to characterize hydrologically relevant differences between places is at the core of our science. A common way to quantitatively characterize hydrological catchments is through the use of descriptors that summarize relevant physical aspects of the system, typically by aggregating heterogeneous geospatial information into a single number. Such descriptors capture various facets of catchment functioning and structure, identify similarity or dissimilarity among catchments, and transfer hydrological information to unobserved locations. However, so far there is no agreement on how catchment descriptors should be selected, aggregated, and evaluated. Even worse, little is known about the existence of potential biases in the current practices to characterize catchments. In this systematic review, we analyze 742 research articles published between 1967 and 2021 to provide a categorized overview of current and historical practices of catchment characterization (i.e., data sources, aggregation and evaluation methods) in hydrological science and related disciplines. We uncover the existence of substantial biases in catchment characterization: (1) only 16% of the analyzed studies are in dry environments, even though such environments cover 42% of global land surface, suggesting that most catchment descriptors are tailored to represent energy-limited environments and are potentially less effective in water-limited environments; (2) only 30% of studies use subsurface features for catchment characterization despite the dominance of subsurface flow; (3) only 4% and 9% of descriptors are aggregated in spatially- and vertically-differentiated way, respectively, while the majority of descriptors are simple averages and do not account for hydrologically-relevant variabilities of features within catchments; (4) 25% of all studies analyzed do not evaluate the usefulness of catchment descriptors, and none quantifies their uncertainty. We demonstrate the potential effects of these biases on our ability to effectively characterize catchments and identify functional similarity of catchment behavior with illustrative examples. Finally, we suggest possible ways to derive more robust, comprehensive and hydrologically meaningful catchment descriptors.

AB  - Using survey data during 2001–2013 from a total of 38 lakes in the Poyang Lake region of China, we analyzed the inter-annual change in crane populations and the spatial distribution of crane species. Across the study sites, the total crane population was 6400±2620 individuals during the period 2001–2013. Crane populations varied widely across the study sites: the largest crane population was observed on Bang Lake with an annual average of 2373, followed by Qi Lake, Dacha Lake, and Zhu Lake. The four main crane species, which were active on 50–80% of study lakes during the period of investigation, were G. leucogeranus, G. monacha, G. vipio, and G. grus. In particular, G. leucogeranus, G. monacha, and G. vipio were observed mainly in Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve and nearby lakes. G. grus was mostly observed in Poyang County. The largest populations of G. leucogeranus, G. vipio, and G. monacha were observed on Bang Lake, with annual averages of 1229, 985, and 88 birds, respectively. The largest G. grus population was observed on Qi Lake, with an annual average of 756 birds. We found that habitats for G. leucogeranus, G. monacha, and G. vipio were defined by similar environmental factors. In particular, increasing distance from roads had a positive impact on populations of these three species. By contrast, sedimentary total phosphorus content showed negative correlations with populations of all four main crane species, which implied that eutrophication could pose a threat to these rare crane species.

AB  - The deployment of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) to GtCO2 scale by the mid-century is integral to realising net zero. Some CDR methods are technically maturing whilst some are in the early stages of innovation. At the same time, first mover nations are implementing policy and regulatory frameworks to establish this sector. Policy analysis around CDR has therefore become an area of focus as a function of its importance in establishing, developing and scaling a just, equitable and sustainable net zero transition. Policy development for sustainable transitions tends to use consolidative modelling approaches. These, often protracted, analyses can become quickly outdated in dynamic fast-moving sectors, and be unable to manage the multiple objectives that actors seek when innovating. The innovation rate required to scale the CDR sector and the extent of uncertainty to realise net zero, questions the applicability of these approaches. This research proposes a novel rapid policy analysis process, based on the decision theatre format, that uses strategic foresight to develop anticipatory, values-based CDR policy insights. This contribution prototypes this rapid approach on two pioneer national CDR developers - the United Kingdom and United States. Through its application, the method identifies opportunities for globally collaborative CDR policy intervention - a roadmap, a coordination hub, and agile policy processes - supported by regional policy specialisations - coordinating offices, measurement standards, and public capacity building - to achieve GtCO2 scale CDR deployment. Most importantly, the proposed approach provides a rapid method for sustainable transitions policy analysis in contexts of deep uncertainty.

AB  - At present, domain adaptation (DA) methods have made noteworthy advancements in cross-scene hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Their success largely hinges on the alignment of distributions between source and target domains, which is a critical step in extracting domain-invariant features. However, this intense focus on domain-invariant feature extraction frequently leads to the neglect of class-discriminative features, limiting their utility in cross-scene coastal wetland classification, where the nuanced identification of different classes is crucial. In this paper, a feature disentanglement based domain adaptation network (FDDAN) is proposed to disentangle and exclude domain-specific features and class-invariant features, thereby obtaining class-specific domain-invariant features for classification tasks. Specifically, a transformer and convolution fusion-based feature extraction network is designed to capture global–local mixed features. To align domain distributions and learn shared features, two corresponding disentanglers separate domain-invariant features and domain-specific features from mixed features. Furthermore, to allow domain-invariant features containing purer category discriminative information, class-invariant features are also segregated. In addition, an adversarial learning strategy between three features is utilized to simultaneously enhance the transferability and discriminability of domain-invariant features. The effectiveness of FDDAN is demonstrated by the experimental results obtained from three cross-scene unmanned aerial vehicle datasets collected in coastal wetlands and a publicly available dataset. We will make our datasets and source code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

AB  - The construction of contour levees for rice irrigation represents a major landscape management activity with impacts on irrigation water use efficiency, crop management decisions, and food production. However, levee distribution information traditionally relies on local field surveys because remote sensing approaches are complicated by irregular spacing, shape, and landscape variability within the field. In this paper the authors develop a deep learning approach capable of identifying rice fields with contour style levee irrigation practices from open-source aerial imagery. To generate a levee-identification scheme, a hybrid ResNet/Unet model is built from the commonly known Residual Network (ResNet) architecture for multi-layer deep learning strategies. The model takes a 320 × 320 RGB aerial landscape image from the US National Agricultural Imagery Program as input along with label data to then generate a probability map of the distribution of farm fields that use contour levees within the image. In performing this task, the model generates a 0.991 receiver operating characteristic curve score. The model continues to perform well under the introduction of clouds, data augmentation, or minor reductions in spatial resolution. Throughout these tests, the model performed within 0.2 of its original score, except for when the image quality was reduced to 60 m wherein the model score dropped to 0.691. Via these tests the model demonstrates potential to function well given different spatial extents or potential satellite remote sensing with moderate (10 m) resolutions. This model provides a proof-of-concept for the use of aerial imagery and a deep learning strategy for irrigation-type mapping practices.

AB  - This research examines the evolution of olive landscapes in Cartoceto, Italy, post-World War II. This study investigates the structural and functional attributes of two distinct olive cultivation models, mixed olive groves with a low tree density and high-density olive groves. The research employs remote sensing aerial imagery and land use cartography to reconstruct the past terrain and classify distinct categories of olive orchards. Landscape metrics are utilised to evaluate the impact of human and natural factors on the temporal development of olive landscapes across multiple spatial configurations, defined as Landscape-scale and sub-units or Landscape Units. The results indicate that olive landscapes have experienced noteworthy alterations, characterised by a reduction in the conventional large-scale system and an increase in specialised planting models of smaller sizes, classified as “high intensity”. The region surrounding Cartoceto's historic centre has conserved a greater variety of mixed olive heritage and has witnessed the emergence of novel high densities of trees compared to other areas. Obtaining these results has been facilitated solely by utilising diverse spatial configurations of smaller sub-units than the entire landscape. The outcomes of this investigation provide a foundation for forthcoming enquiries into olive terrains and the development of sustainable rural landscape strategies.

AB  - People residing near stable urban heat islands (UHIs) experience a high long-term heat exposure, and the health consequences of such islands may be more severe than those of an expanding UHI; however, these areas are hidden in the overall heat island and not focused on. We developed a novel approach to identify the locations and ranges of stable UHIs by considering multiple frequency urban heat islands (MFUHIs). The MFUHIs were identified through multi-temporal remote sensing data and morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), and the approach was applied in the case area of Beijing, the capital city of China. Specifically, the MFUHIs in Beijing were classified according to the landscape characteristics, based on the field survey and remote sensing data. The landscape indicators included land-use types, biophysical parameters (normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), proportion of water areas, and impervious surface area (ISA)) and 3-D metrics (building density and building heights), which were considered causative factors. The relationship between the land surface temperature and landscape indicators was examined using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regressions and the Area Weighted Contribution Index (AWCI). The results showed that the MFUHIs in Beijing have four key zones, in which the surface temperature is more than 9 ℃ higher than the average temperature of the urban area, and the air temperature is 3.3–8.5 ℃ higher than the built-up temperature in the non-UHI area. The OLS regression and spatial statistics of the landscape indicators and surface temperature indicated that the regions in which area where MFUHIs occur could be characterised by a relatively high degree of impervious surface coverage, lack of green space and water area, and presence of low-rise and high-density buildings. The average number of building-floors in MFUHIs was between 1.93 and 2.64, and the number of floors in the entire study area was less than 3.6. Moreover, the building-densities in the MFUHIs were 16.25% to 27.62% higher than that in the whole study area. According to the result of the AWCI and field survey, the MFUHIs were classified into transportation, historical block, commercial, and city village high-temperature centre. The main findings indicated that certain regions between the city centre and rural areas, in which sound planning is not implemented, are the hotspots of UHI mitigation and risk elimination regions. The proposed approach can help policymakers develop targeted mitigation strategies in urban planning.

AB  - Remotely sensed observations are crucial for conducting meteorological studies, particularly over complex mountainous terrains such as, the North-Western Himalayas (NWH), which are characterized by a very sparse and uneven distribution of ground observatories. These complex terrains are subject to huge inter-basin climatic and topographic heterogeneity, which often induces large inconsistencies in the form of varying rainfall estimations and observations among the satellite-based gridded precipitation products (GPPs). This underpins the need for a detailed sub-regional validation of GPPs and attribution of the observed discrepancies over such complex terrains. This study provides a comprehensive validation analysis of four major high-resolution GPPs (TMPA-3B42V7, CHIRPS-V2.0, CMORPH-CDR, and PERSIANN-CDR) against the in-situ gridded observations provided by IMD, across the six sub-basins of NWH. Utilizing various descriptive, statistical, and categorical metrics, we evaluated the daily, seasonal, and annual rainfall climatology for each dataset and also extracted their longitudinal and latitudinal error profiles and detection capabilities as a function of elevation and local relief. High inconsistencies were observed among the datasets, with each dataset performing differently over different sub-basins. All the datasets underperformed IMD over higher elevations, while TMPA-3B42V7 performed better even over the Upper Indus sub-basin. CHIRPS-V2.0 performed well over Jhelum, and Chenab sub-basins, whereas the CDR version of CMORPH, performed well over the flatter terrains of Ravi, Beas, and Satluj sub-basins, particularly during the summer monsoons. The IR-based PERSIANN-CDR, on the other hand, failed to capture the daily rainfall estimates and underperformed IMD throughout NWH. The findings further highlight low detection capability of datasets at higher rainfall thresholds, indicating underestimation of extreme rainfall. With respect to the relationship between GPPs performance and topographic components, the results showed that the occurrence frequency of rain detection in GPPs decreases, while the occurrence frequency of over-detection increases with increase in elevation and local relief. Although, the performance of GPPs co-varies with both topographic components, local relief governed by the multi-step topographic gradients comprising valleys, orographic fronts, and orographic interiors was observed to have a more profound effect on error profiles. Lastly, the study identifies and discusses the probable regional (e.g., rainfall structure, orographic influence, biophysical, data scarcity, spatial resolution), and product-specific (e.g., source of generation, remote sensing instrumentation, satellite algorithms, data assimilation techniques) factors attributing to the inconsistencies observed among the datasets. The findings from the present research offer insights to the algorithm developers for improving product accuracy and hydro-meteorologist for utilizing appropriate GPP over respective sub-basin.

AB  - Landscapes have typically been produced by varied, diverse, and long-term interactions between people and nature. However, most landscape planning and ecosystem service mapping approaches focus on the biophysical aspects of landscapes rather the social. Spatial representations of people’s perceptions, mental models, and local knowledge of ecosystem services can be created using participatory mapping. This study uses participatory mapping to identify how peoples’ perceptions of provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem service supply areas coincide or mismatch with the landscapes features of two Mediterranean river basin areas in north-eastern Catalonia, Spain. We found that the random forest and geographically weighted regression techniques are able to strongly associate landscape features with stakeholders’ perceptions of ecosystem supply areas. These results demonstrate that the stakeholders associate various geographic elements with different types of ecosystem service supply areas. Visible geographical features, such as a reservoir, mountains, wetlands, showed great importance in the perception of supply areas of ecosystem services, compared to ecological or biophysical indicators, when mapping and spatially associating certain benefits to ecosystem services supply areas. These findings reveal that, often, the ecological processes and dynamics of functioning of ecosystems are invisible and not fully understood. We argue that integrating these aspects into participatory landscape planning, policies and practice can make the invisible visible and, consequently, increase the understanding for a more targeted and effective management. This could allow stakeholders to better understand the ecological processes behind the visible geographic features of the landscape, fostering a shared knowledge and better environmental management outcomes.

AB  - Sustainable land use in agricultural landscapes is essential to counteract the global decline of biodiversity, as well to ensure ecosystem services like natural pest control. Phytoseiid mites are key natural enemies of pest mites in vineyards but how local management and landscape context affect phytoseiid mites remains poorly known. In this study, we examined the effects of farming systems, inter-row management and landscape composition on phytoseiid mite communities in 156 vineyards across five European wine-growing regions. Our results showed that phytoseiid communities were mainly dominated by one or two phytoseiid species across Europe and that local management was a major factor affecting population densities. According to the wine-growing regions, phytoseiid mite densities benefited from integrated pest management or conventional farming compared to organic farming and from spontaneous vegetation cover compared to seeded cover crops. Moreover, mite densities benefited from increasing proportions of vineyards at the landscape scale. The farming systems effects were most likely related to the positive impact of the lower pesticide use in integrated and conventional vineyards. The positive effect of spontaneous vegetation cover could be related to a better supply of nutritive pollen as food resource compared to seeded cover crops, which depends on the plant species in the inter-row. Our findings indicated accordingly that a reduced pesticide use, and inter-row management are crucial factors for promoting pest control by predatory mites in European vineyards. Moreover, the proportion of viticultural area in the landscape is a considerable factor to retain stable phytoseiid mite populations.

AB  - Place names are a linguistic form that people attach to the landscape. Rural landscapes are maybe one of the most refined cultural manifestations revealing a fundamental effort for human existence and locating their actions through place names. In this research, place names were used as a means to explore rural landscape characters of the Serik district in the Turkish Mediterranean. A total number of 1243 place names were subcategorised in four large character groups: natural features, land use, cultural, and visual features and were further analysed into twenty indicative landscape characteristics. The results showed that characteristics of the rural landscape in Serik were dominated by two main components: biophysical features as a response to the natural environment and the position of a locality in relation to maintenance of local livelihoods. In conclusion, the accuracy and validity of place names is still quite precise in the definition of the characters in rural landscapes where intact human-nature relations are unique but whose characters have been under the pressure of fragmentation. Here, the knowledge of multi-layered forms of place names offers a readily available rich inventory that can be applied to the planning and management of rural landscapes,particularly in the absence of other biophysical and cultural data.

AB  - Understanding the village characteristics linked to forest networks is essential for the scientific management of forest resources. Forests are complex socio-ecological systems. This study classifies the resources and characteristics of forest networks and neighboring villages using unsupervised learning algorithms: self-organizing maps (SOM) and geographic-self-organizing maps (Geo-SOMs). Considering ecological, economic, and sociocultural indicators, 18 covariates of 379 villages in two forest networks of the Baekdudaegan Mountain Range in South Korea were analyzed. The data visualizing map size was fixed based on changes in quantization and topographic errors of the same grid maps, and the number of clusters was determined by comparing K-means and hierarchical clustering techniques. An optimal map size of 17 × 12 grids and six clusters was used for further classification of the input data for both SOM and Geo-SOM analyses. The common characteristics of villages were identified using SOM classification, whereas geographically bounded characteristics were identified using Geo-SOM. The approach introduced in this study can be applied to socio-ecological classification and the design of sustainable forest management policies that link the remote sensing and geographic information systems.

AB  - A study into the topical issue of environmental quality assessment by a range of indicators is given a review in the paper. An integrated approach is made use of in the research which is based on the case study of the Odessa industrial-and-urban agglomeration (IUA). Quality assessment of the natural components of the Odessa IUA environment by means of integrated indices of the natural environmental status and the natural component quality revealed that the studied urban ecosystem is impersistent on the whole, however, the environmental quality is quite favorable and the technogenic load is low. The environmental reliability of the studied area was classified as low. Prospects for development of Odessa Agglomeration, despite the complicated environmental situation, are quite favorable, due to the advantageous economic and geographical location, and the well-developed research, technical and recreational potential. Application of the structural analysis approach to definition of the adaptation strategy for the area makes it possible to suggest the ways for optimization of the natural environment component in the Odessa IUA. The assessment criteria for the area under study and the suggested adaptive governance tools constitute the research outcomes.

AB  - Current agricultural practices in Europe are increasingly aggravating societal and environmental safety concerns. This creates social and regulatory pressures on farmers, which can lead to declining material and social status of farmers, farmer discontent, and anti-regulation protests. These tensions are rooted in conflicting value systems for agricultural development, which can range from productivist pathways (i.e. valuing production above all else) to increasing multifunctionality pathways (i.e. valuing agriculture for its contribution to multiple economic, environmental and societal needs). It is largely unknown to what degree individual farms and agricultural landscapes are transitioning towards increasing productivism or multifunctionality in practice. Here, we mapped landscape changes and interviewed farmers (n = 274) to examine the diversity of agricultural development pathways in 17 study sites across Europe over the last 20 years (2000–2020). We also assessed the associations between the development pathways and farmers’ perceptions of socio-economic outcomes, namely job satisfaction, societal valuation, and economic performance. Farm-level development was largely aligned with productivist pathways, while landscape-level changes aligned more closely with an increasing multifunctionality pathway. Farmers on pathways of increasing multifunctionality did not perceive improved outcomes on livelihood indicators as compared to productivist farmers. Furthermore, farms on increasing multifunctionality pathways were concentrated in sites with very high management intensities that face strong pressure from environmental regulations, as well as low-intensity, mountainous sites, where opportunities for intensification are limited. These results suggest that current pathways that increase multifunctionality arise mostly by necessity. Successful agricultural transformation will therefore require policy to create enabling environments that provide socioeconomic benefits for farmers to increase multifunctionality, and a civil society and market conditions that value sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Decoupling the intricate relationship between three-dimensional (3D) urban morphology and local climate is paramount importance in the realm of adaptive urban planning. Research based on Local Climate Zone (LCZ) has exhibited promising potential for disentangling the interactive mechanisms between urban morphology and local climate. In this study, generative adversarial networks (GAN) were employed as surrogate models to facilitate the integration of LCZ and urban morphology data from six metropolises for associative training. Through comparative experiments involving quantitative and qualitative evaluations, a rapid and responsive 3D morphology prediction model was developed for LCZ classifications. The results demonstrated the superior convergence capabilities and accuracy of the Pix2pix model (RMSE = 0.187 and R2 = 0.878) when compared to the CycleGAN model (RMSE = 0.344 and R2 = 0.674). The predicted 3D morphologies showcased a pronounced alignment with their respective LCZs, as evidenced by the precise representation of open low-rise buildings and their interrelationships with the coastline in the Sydney sample, as well as the accurate portrayal of the complex urban morphology shaped by compact high-rise buildings and road networks in the Tokyo sample. Utilizing indices calculated from the 3D morphology, the model yielded an average overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficient, and F1 score of 85.2%, 0.83, and 0.86, respectively, indicating the robustness and adaptability of the model. The framework presented in this research offers practitioners a solid foundation and valuable insights for enhancing the local climate in urban areas through the implementation of 3D generative design techniques.

AB  - With global warming and rapid urban growth, cities get warmer, which poses additional stress on human thermal comfort and health. Complex three-dimensional (3D) urban forms change radiation fluxes and shade patterns in cities, but most studies that link urban form to thermal exposure have traditionally investigated the horizontal, two-dimensional composition and configuration of urban landscapes. Supported by high-precision airborne LiDAR data and IKONOS satellite data, this study calculates 3D urban landscape metrics for central Nanjing, China, including vegetation above ground biomass (AGB), building volume (VB), standard deviation of building and vegetation heights (HSDB, HSDV), the building normalized compactness radio (nCR), sky view factor (SVF), surface roughness (SR), and shadow patterns (SP). Diurnal hourly mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is simulated using the UMEP (Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor) tool forced with fixed-point observation data for a typical hot summer day. Correlation and multiple regression analyses are conducted to investigate the relationship between the 3D form metrics and Tmrt and to identify key factors that influence the thermal environment. Tmrt varies spatially and diurnally and is strongly related to SP during the day, revealing the importance of solar access for modulating the thermal environment. AGB is negatively, but SVF, SP, and building nCR are positively correlated with daytime Tmrt. At night, Tmrt is more homogeneous across space and mainly impacted by the urban fabric's ability to lose heat. Open areas cool faster than areas with low SVF and complex urban forms with high building nCR. Findings from this study have great scientific and practical significance for optimizing urban landscape patterns from a human-centered heat exposure perspective and will guide planning and design strategies to promote thermally comfortable urban environments.

AB  - CONTEXT
Farmland enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a negative emission technology that accelerates CO2 sequestration into the soil inorganic carbon (SIC) sink by applying calcium and magnesium-rich silicate rock to agricultural soils. Farmland ERW has great CO2 removal potential and is accompanied by various co-benefits, such as improving soil pH and providing mineral nutrients. However, the environment-driven mechanisms of ERW remain unclear, and the uncertainty on crop productivity also requires further evaluation in field trials.
OBJECTIVE
We tried to explore the response of crop productivity and soil inorganic carbon to ERW in farmland and analyze the contribution and prioritization of environment drivers for the above change.
METHODS
A series of monitoring trials were established in a multi-agroclimatic region in central China from 2019 to 2021. Firstly, crop productivity and SIC change mediated by ERW were evaluated by applying 10 kg m−2 mixed rock powder in field trials. Secondly, the random forest and correlation network analysis were used to quantify the influence of climate, soil, and management drivers on yield and SIC change. Finally, the carbon footprint of silicate rock powder was calculated by life cycle analysis.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Farmland ERW significantly improved the crop yield (7 ± 4.3%) and biomass (11 ± 4.6%) in the whole region. In the low water balance region, the net carbon sequestration during three years caused by ERW was 4.31 ± 0.82 t-CO2 ha−1, which increased the carbon capture of the agricultural system by 1.6–2.4 times. Contribution analysis showed that soil pH had the highest relative importance (18%) on yield change mediated by ERW. Low soil pH was conducive to yield and nutrient effectiveness increases, and the largest yield increase reached 31 ± 6.9%. Water balance (rainfall/evapotranspiration) was the dominant driver affecting (20%) inorganic carbon sequestration, the accumulation of SIC in low water balance reached 3.8 times that in high water balance regions. Moreover, fertilizer input also significantly correlated with ERW field effect, and N input significantly increased the SIC in the arid region.
SIGNIFICANCE
This study provided detailed field data for large-scale potential analysis of ERW in farmland. These findings contribute to understanding the environmental influence of ERW and assisting decision-making for ERW layout. Moreover, our results could inspire soil improvement in regions with soil acidification and mineral nutrient shortages.

AB  - Due to the scarcity of air temperature (Ta) observations, urban heat studies often rely on satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) to characterise the near-surface thermal environment. However, there remains a lack of a quantitative understanding on how LST differs from Ta within urban areas and what are the controlling factors of their interaction. We use crowdsourced air temperature measurements in Sydney, Australia, combined with urban landscape data, Local Climate Zones (LCZ), high-resolution satellite imagery, and machine learning to explore the influence of urban form and fabric on the interaction between Ta and LST. Results show that LST and Ta have distinct spatiotemporal characteristics, and their relationship differs by season, ecological infrastructure, and building morphology. We found greater seasonal variability in LST compared to Ta, along with more pronounced intra-urban spatial variability in LST, particularly in warmer seasons. We also observed a greater temperature difference between LST and Ta in the built environment compared to the natural LCZs, especially during warm days. Natural LCZs (areas with mostly dense and scattered trees) showed stronger LST-Ta relationships compared to built areas. In particular, we observe that built areas with higher building density (where the heat vulnerability is likely more pronounced) show insignificant or negative relationships between LST- Ta in summer. Our results also indicate that surface cover, distance from the ocean, and seasonality significantly influence the distribution of hot and cold spots for LST and Ta. The spatial distribution for Ta hot spots does not always overlap with LST. We find that relying solely on LST as a direct proxy for the urban thermal environment is inappropriate, particularly in densely built-up areas and during warm seasons. These findings provide new perspectives on the relationship between surface and canopy temperatures and how these relate to urban form and fabric.

AB  - Agriculture is an essential sector needed for survival of the human community. Several measures have been taken to enhance the crop production. However harsh environmental conditions and frequent pest infestation lead to the agricultural loss. In such scenario, integration of advanced technologies such as advanced sensors coupled with Internet of Things (IoT) could escalate the agricultural production and minimize the economic loss. Studies have been conducted across the world that satisfactorily demonstrated the implication of integrated IoT-smart sensors in monitoring environmental factors such as moisture, humidity, temperature, and soil composition that are critical for crop growth. Green house gases such as Carbon dioxide, Methane, etc., are also measured through automated sensors. Smart farming also enables measurement of nitrogen contents in soil that helps farmers to determine the amount of fertilizers to be used in farm lands. Some IoT-enabled equipments and unmanned aerial vehicles are useful in accurate surveillance of pest attack and associated diseases in farm vegetation. Though the smart farming has great scopes in future, it faces certain limitations related to high implementation cost, data security, and lack of sufficient digital knowledge in farmers. Special economic policies, data encryption, and digital literacy could ease IoT-enabled smart farming in future.

AB  - The Port of Rotterdam is a heavily man-modified estuarine system, Europe's major seaport and home to a large number of chemical and petrochemical plants, many of which are supplied with distilled water from two demineralized water plants in Botlek and Maasvlakte. In this study, we assessed the ecological conditions near the brine outfalls and at a reference site unimpacted by brine, focusing on the benthic macrofaunal composition. Overall, the analysis of the communities and species revealed a similar macrobenthic composition, although with lower abundance and diversity compared to the nearby North Sea environment. The outfall area of the Botlek demineralized water plant, which is a dead-end entirely marine waterway with no to little currents in contrast to the well flushed brackish environment of the outfall of the Maasvlakte demineralized water plant, was characterized by the lowest abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates, species richness and Shannon diversity index. Higher biodiversity values at the Maasvlakte demineralized water plant compared to the reference site were also associated with the presence of a large biogenic reef of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas with specimens of over 8 years estimated age being observed, however with many dead individuals recorded at the time of surveys. The outfall area of the Botlek demineralized water plant also had the highest disturbance levels according to the results of AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) in conjunction with Benthos Ecosystem Quality Index (BEQI). Its community was dominated by the opportunistic native species Capitella capitata and Varicorbula gibba, and species typical for organic matter enrichment such as Alitta succinea (native), Streblospio cf shrubsolii (native) and Theora lubrica (invasive), which correlates well with higher levels of anthropogenic pollution in this area. Generalized linear model (GLM) and distance-based multivariate linear model (DistLM) showed that the distance from the outfalls was an important factor in terms of brine impacts however explaining a small part of the variation observed. Similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER), multivariate analysis, and permutational multivariate analysis (PERMANOVA) showed low similarity between and within study sites, confirming that high levels of heterogeneity exist within the estuarine system in terms of natural conditions and anthropogenic stress.

AB  - Despite utilizing various remote sensing datasets, precise tree-cutting detection remains challenging due to spatial and spectral resolution constraints in satellite imagery, complex landscapes, data integration issues, and the need for accurate multi-temporal reference datasets. This study investigates the utilization of PlanetScope (PS) satellite images, along with pixel-based (PBIA) and object-based (OBIA) image analysis, for accurate mapping of forest cover and detection of tree cuttings. Detailed multi-temporal reference datasets were collected based on airborne laser scanning (ALS)-derived canopy height models (CHM) and very high-resolution (VHR) aerial orthomosaics. Reference datasets were used to train three machine learning (ML) models: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and feed-forward neural network (Nnet) in two forest districts located in Western and Northern Poland. The study also assessed the generalization capabilities of the best model in both local and temporal contexts. Regarding forest cover mapping, the OBIA RF classifier outperformed all other models with an overall accuracy (OA) of 99.27 % and Kappa of 98.18 %, while the PBIA SVM model showed the lowest (OA = 97.18 %, Kappa = 94.35 %). The testing of the model's generalization confirmed the performance of the OBIA RF model, with the Dice Coefficient ranging from 95.86 % to 96.74 %. The methodology's effectiveness in tree-cutting detection was demonstrated, with the detection rate ranging from 96.20 % to 99.39 % for the total number of cuttings, and from 99.45 % to 99.86 % for the total volume. In conclusion, the integration of PS satellite images, spectral-textural features, and generalized ML models proves to be effective for tree-cutting detection.

AB  - Rivers and streams worldwide have degraded ecosystems due to a wide range of anthropomorphic drivers and pressures. Recent decades have seen the rise of an interdisciplinary science of stream restoration, which seeks to rehabilitate damaged systems to yield degraded or destroyed ecosystem services. About $1 billion is expended annually on such projects in the United States alone, exclusive of several extraordinary projects that target whole regions or long reaches of larger rivers. The best approaches for restoring rivers are far from settled, as few projects have been sufficiently monitored to positively document effects. Future efforts should feature monitoring and sharing of information, working at larger spatial scales, and restoration of key processes rather than forms.

AB  - Species Distribution Models (SDM) represent a powerful tool to predict species’ habitat suitability on a landscape and fill the gap between truncated observation data and all possible locations. SDMs have been widely used in theoretical studies of species niches as well as in conservation applications. Here, we evaluated the impacts of predictors’ type on models’ performances and spatial predictions using 72 plant species belonging to six ecological groups at a regional scale in the area of Geneva (Switzerland). Twelve models were created using various combinations of high-resolution (25 m) explanatory variables including topography, pedology, climate, habitats and remote sensing data. Models integrating a combination of habitats and topopedo-climatic predictors had significantly higher performances, while remote sensing predictors showed low performances. Our results suggest that the number and the level of details of habitat predictors (broad or very precise) do not fundamentally affect prediction maps. However, selecting too few, overly simplified or exceedingly complex habitat predictors tend to lower models’ performances. The use of eight habitat categories complemented with eight topopedo-climatic predictors produced models with the highest performances. Ecological groups of species responded differently to models and while alpine and ruderal species have greater average performances due to a high affinity with topopedo-climatic predictors, wetlands’ species were less performant on average. These results underline the necessity of developing or having access to habitats distribution data especially in a conservation context.

AB  - The significance of outdoor environment is increasingly being recognized, particularly for the elderly. Using residential community green spaces is beneficial for their physical and mental health. This study aims to explore the thermal comfort, usage patterns, and microclimate preferences of the elderly through environmental factors and demographic information. Field measurements and questionnaire surveys were conducted across 19 residential communities in 3 cities within Building Climate Zone II in China during the summer. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were employed to examine various factors related to the elderly's thermal comfort, duration of activity, and microclimate preferences. The study revealed that elderly residents in communities of various types experience different thermal comfort levels and have different durations of activity and preferences for microclimates. In addition, elderly adults with longer activity durations are less likely to prefer windless, drier, and more sunlight environments in the summer. Built environmental factors, personal factors, and features of public facilities were also found to have an impact on thermal comfort and activity. These empirical findings provide urban planners with insights to better cater to the needs of the elderly in residential area design, emphasizing the importance of considering thermal comfort and microclimate preferences in the planning process.

AB  - This article reviews critical social science analyses of carbon accounting and monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems associated with reducing emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and conservation, sustainable use and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+). REDD+ MRV systems are often portrayed as technical. In questioning such a framing, we draw on perspectives from science and technology and governmentality studies to assess how MRV systems may exercise disciplinary power (through standardization, simplification and erasing the local) but also mobilize counter-expertise, produce resistance and thus have necessarily contingent effects. In doing so, we advance the concept of ‘carbon accountability’ to denote both how forest carbon is accounted for in REDD+ and the need to hold to account those who are doing so.

During the last deglaciation, changes in rates of sea-level rise led to moments of stillstand and rapid rise acceleration, forming and drowning distinct shelf geomorphological features. Here, we present and discuss the morphology and associated habitats related to submerged reefs and inter-reef areas along the southern Abrolhos inner shelf (western South Atlantic, Brazil). Our aim is to discuss the morphological evidence of reef drowning and related sea-level/climate events, and the formation of distinct habitats during the post-Last Glacial Maximum transgression. Multibeam echosounder data and sub-aquatic video footage are the basic datasets. Automatic seabed classification was carried out by combining morphometric analysis, acoustic backscatter and ground-truthing. Results show the presence of two clusters of submerged reefs (14-23 m and 24-35 m deep), associated with longitudinal and transverse bedforms, banks, and shelf-incised valleys. Rhodolith beds comprise the main inter-reef benthic habitat. Distinct reef clusters defined by reef top depths indicate that reef drowning occurred in two different moments. The shallower reefs are likely related to the rapid sea-level rise associated with MWP 1C, while deeper reefs are interpreted as remanent carbonate build-ups. Habitats are strongly influenced by the marine geodiversity forming a mosaic of reef, inter-reef and bedforms classes that seem to be associated with an antecedent paleo landscape marked by shelf-incised valleys and paleochannels. Submarine geomorphology is an environmental component that drives geodiversity and is driven by distinct seafloor processes acting in different time and spatial scales, as well as being able to quantify biogenic phenomena, for example, surrogacy and provide records of sea-level changes.

AB  - Recent global changes have triggered a biodiversity crisis. However, climate fluctuations have always influenced biodiversity and humans have affected species distributions since prehistoric times. Conservation palaeobiology is a developing field that aims to understand the long-term dynamics of such interactions by studying the geohistorical records in a conservation perspective. Case studies exist for vertebrates and plants, but insects have largely been overlooked so far. Here, we analysed the current red-listed beetle species (Coleoptera) in Sweden and investigated their occurrence and representation in the European Quaternary fossil record. Fossil data currently exist for one third of the Swedish red-listed beetle species. All the red-list conservation classes are represented in the fossil record, which may allow for comparative studies. We found significantly different representations in the fossil records among taxonomic groups and ecological traits, which may depend on the fossil depositional and sampling environments and variation in how difficult species are to identify. Species that are today associated with modern urban environments were mostly found in Quaternary sites with archaeological human settlements, reflecting early human-driven environmental change. Combining modern and fossil insect species data for biodiversity conservation needs to be undertaken with care, and attention paid to biases in both modern and palaeo-data. Nevertheless, this approach opens new opportunities for conservation biology by providing a millennial-scale perspective on biodiversity change, including consideration of the long-term dynamics of species range shifts, species invasions and regional extinctions under changing climates.

AB  - A regolith map for the Lawra Belt has been developed by categorising the regolith-landform units by processing and interpreting remote sensing data. Regolith landform units were extracted from Landsat band ratios 3/1 and 5/4 to map ferruginous saprolite and lags; band ratio 5/7 was used to identify residual regolith and band ratio 4/2 was employed to separate ferruginous units from non-ferruginous regolith. Additional regolith landform units' discrimination was provided by compiling and interpolating radiometric data particularly for Landsat TM poorly defined areas. SRTM images were used to mark out the extent of the alluvial plains. High topographical terrains were marked from DEM image to represent the residual areas. Regolith landform unit (RLU) map that showed residual (relict and erosional), ferruginous, and depositional domains of the Lawra Belt was developed by superimposing the extractions made from the remote sensed data. Interpretive map generated from the remote sensed image analysis was validated by first creating a non-genetic regolith map through ground truth survey. The non-genetic map based on spatial distributions of the different regolith mapping units were classified on genetic classes or regimes based on regolith-landform similarities to develop a genetic map. The interpretive and the genetic map were superimposed to develop the regolith map for the Lawra Belt. The inliers and outliers presenting compositional overlaps within broad regolith classes were rectified from the field mapping information. The combined approach of image analysis and the ground truth mapping grouped the regolith of Lawra Belt into ferruginous (F), relict (R), erosional (E) and depositional (D) regimes.

AB  - High-latitude terrestrial ecosystems are crucial to the global climate system and its regulation by vegetation. Since productivity of boreal forests is much limited by low summer temperatures, it is expected that trees subjected to warming are progressively decreasing their regional growth coherence in the last decades. In this study, we used a comprehensive network of indexed ring-width records to assess 20th-century spatiotemporal patterns of climatic sensitivity of forest growth around the Urals mountain range above 60 °N (ca. 750,000 km2). This area offers an excellent opportunity to test for warming effects as most north Eurasian conifers (including Larix, Picea and Pinus species) are found along a north-to-south temperature gradient across contrasting soil hydrothermal regimes (permafrost and permafrost-free). We observed positive associations between indexed ring-width and summer temperature over the past century, decreasing southwards. However, weaker (permafrost) or non-significant (permafrost-free) relationships were consistently found at the local and regional scales after 1960. A cointegration analysis indicated that tree-growth release from cold limitation significantly reduced the degree and spatial extent of synchronous growth at short- (annual) and long-term (decadal) scales, most likely by exposing forests to endogenous (local) factors (e.g., competition, soil properties, nutrient availability) and species-specific reactions. Whereas the loss of temperature sensitivity progressively reduced non-permafrost synchrony by 50% over the whole 20th century, permafrost forests decreased their synchrony only after the 1960s, by 20%. Radial growth was enhanced in permafrost sites, as suggested by increasing basal area increment. Our results unequivocally link a substantial decrease in temporal coherence of forest productivity in boreal ecosystems to a growth release from cold limitation that is concurrent with regional warming trends. This emerging pattern points to increasing dependence on local drivers of the carbon balance and the role as carbon sinks of forests in the northern Ural region.

AB  - The progress in intensive production over recent decades have greatly altered land-use patterns, often resulting in simplified landscapes. Intensive production is particularly necessary in mountainous areas where arable land resources are scarce, but it is a pervasive concern that landscape simplification will increase pressure for mountain flood disaster control. In this study, rainfall, runoff and sediment process data from 1995 to 2015 were observed for a typical intensively developed mountainous watershed. Data were used to investigate the effects of intensive production on the hydrological response characteristics discharge, suspended sediment concentration, runoff depth, and sediment load under three different rainfall regimes, namely rainfall regimes I (long duration, light rainfall intensity), II (short duration, high rainfall intensity), and III (long duration, high amount). Orchard area in the watershed increased from 4.43 % to 37.44 % under intensive production from 1995 to 2015. Intensive production led to high-intensity land use as well as homogenization and simplification of the landscape, which inevitably caused changes in hydrological processes in the mountainous watershed. Intensive production resulted in a significant downward trend in runoff coefficients (p = 0.001) and sediment loads (p = 0.006) under the three different rainfall regimes. Average sediment concentration decreased significantly and continuously (2394 to 12.53 kg m−3) during the 20 years of the study, and average runoff fluctuated but decreased from 0.218 m3/s in 2000 to 0.093 m3/s in 2015. According to hysteresis analysis, the proportion of counterclockwise loop events decreased after intensive production but remained the dominant circulation mode (40 %). The proportion of events in eight-figure loops increased from 0.06 % before intensification to 25 %. The increase in complex circulation implied that development of intensive production increased the sources of sediment in the watershed. The study increases understanding of hydrological responses to intensive production in complex mountainous watersheds and provides practical references for sustainable watershed management and optimization of land use allocation.

AB  - Since the mid-20th century, European landscapes, especially coastal regions, have faced significant transformations influenced by global and national trends, mainly driven by coastalisation. While studies have explored various aspects of coastal landscape changes across Europe and beyond, a fundamental gap remains: understanding how the conceptualisation and integration of landscape within coastal planning instruments impact broader landscape change evolution. This study addresses that gap through an evolutionary explanatory multiple case studies analysis of three municipalities in the Northern Region of Portugal, examining how the conceptualisation and integration of the landscape within three regional coastal planning instruments influenced coastal landscape changes from 1965 to 2018. Findings indicate that the degree of landscape integration varies among the coastal planning instruments, directly impacting the level of landscape protection. Our research suggests that higher levels of landscape integration could significantly enhance coastal landscape protection. An unexpected finding emerged regarding the conceptualisation of the landscape. While one might expect that a holistic conceptualisation would lead to high levels of integration, this was not always the case. Results also highlight how underlying narratives, strongly influenced by the European Union, shaped the interpretation and practical management of coastal landscapes. Our research concludes with a call for further empirical research across diverse geographies to deepen understanding of coastal landscape governance. It also emphasises the need for political will to embrace risks and foster a radical, transformative shift to approach and conceptualise the governance system in line with the changing dynamics and socio-ecological values of coastal landscapes towards coastal landscape governance.

AB  - Vegetation resources have an essential role in sustainable development due to their close relationship with natural resource management and environmental protection. The monitoring of land use and cover is key for a more sustainable management of these resources, and Earth Observation satellites have provided an increasingly powerful platform for performing this task. To date, numerous classification algorithms have been developed for vegetation mapping, but a comparative evaluation of the strategies commonly used in large-scale applications (50000 km2 and above) is lacking. We developed a classification framework based on random forests and Sentinel data within the Google Earth Engine platform to assess the performance of various strategies over a complex landscape with a wide range of vegetation classes, plot configurations, and agricultural practices. These strategies differed in key aspects related to the characteristics of the classifier and the sample, and were evaluated by class-specific and general accuracy metrics. We found that the use of pixel time series features from fusion data, class-balanced labels, and multi-season time frames enhanced overall performance by 1.3%–14.1% over alternative approaches, but in some cases also generated tradeoffs of 1.6%–8.5% between recall and precision. In general, suboptimal strategies were particularly ineffective for the detection of infrequent classes. Finally, the different parameter values used in the random forests did not have a significant influence over the results. Our results demonstrate the importance of algorithm design in the effective classification of multiple vegetation classes, corroborate the usefulness of Sentinel data to generate mapping products of high resolution and accuracy, and highlight the importance of cloud computing tools for the development of vegetation mapping tools in large-scale applications. These findings provide general guidelines for the design of future classification frameworks, which are necessary for facilitating a sustainable management of natural resources worldwide.

AB  - In this study, the dynamics of green spaces and land surface temperature patterns in four cities in Ethiopia were investigated using Landsat imagery. The typical characteristics of LST over the past three decades (1990–2020) in relation to green space dynamics were first investigated; subsequently, the spatial distribution of LST was characterized based on hybrid geospatial techniques and mono-window algorithm analysis, in which the contributions of green spaces to LST were studied. In addition, the multiple linear regression method and spatial regression models (SRMs) were employed to investigate and predict the spatial dependence of LST and urbanization-induced green space dynamics. Results show that cities horizontally expanded unceasingly from 1990 to 2020, with a substantial discrepancy in expansion rates and the spatial patterns of UHI intensities among the cities (p < 0.05). Moreover, the area proportion of the UHI is significantly larger than that of the UGS, and the differences in the UGS cooling contribution were found in different land uses and zones of the cities. In the study periods, the spatial pattern of LST was significantly controlled by NDBI, and its coefficient in the OLS followed the pattern NDVI > MNDWI > latitudes > longitudes > population density > DEM. Due to the large proportions of buildings While green land and water bodies show significant capability to mitigate UHI effects, cooling effects are not apparent when their sizes are small. Besides, the SRMs show that UHI intensities were significantly influenced by MNDWI in Bahir Dar and Hawassa (p < 0.01).Cities' LAMBDA coefficients have a positive relationship with UHII (p < 0.01). Our study could help city planners and the government understand the current cooling potential of existing UGS to mitigate the dynamics of UHI and sustain the sustainability of green space management in cities.

AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) and urban moisture island (UMI) effect can be significant in Hong Kong due to its high-density land utilization, and this can strongly affect building energy performance. While the UHI’ energy impact has been rather intensively studied recently, the UMI effect on latent energy is still underexplored, especially for humid subtropical climate like Hong Kong. This study investigated the intensity of UHI and UMI in Hong Kong, and its impacts on the sensible and latent cooling demand of residential buildings in summer. Firstly, a ten-year weather dataset from 2004–2013 for the six stations selected based on the local climate zone (LCZ) scheme was analysed. The results show that the urban area of Hong Kong appears as both a heat and moisture island during summer nights but as cooling and dry islands during daytime, and the nocturnal UHI and UMI intensity vary significantly with different LCZs. Furthermore, the energy performance of a typical residential building in Hong Kong was simulated with measured weather data for the selected stations as an input. The urban building shows a higher sensible cooling demand, approximately twice that of the comparative rural one, and the latent cooling demand could be up to 96% higher. Both sensible and latent cooling energy demand decrease with increasing LCZ grades. Our study highlights that both UHI and UMI effect should be considered in the estimation of building energy in Hong Kong due to their significant impacts on the cooling energy demand.

AB  - Summary
The urban heat island (UHI) effect has traditionally been determined using ambient air temperatures or land surface temperatures derived from satellite observations. In this study, we used the subsurface temperature anomaly as an indicator in describing a relationship between land use characteristics and aquifer temperature changes in the shallow subsurface layers of three rapidly developing urban settings: the Kanto, Sendai and Chikushi plains in Japan. Information on land cover was derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images acquired between 1999 and 2001. The supervised classification technique along with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to specify the urban degree for grid cells covering observation wells. Preliminary analysis of groundwater levels in different well locations revealed that vertical groundwater recharge is predominant in all study areas. A numerical model for subsurface heat transport employed with different groundwater recharge/discharge and ground surface warming rates indicated that ground surface warming has a significant effect on aquifer temperatures in shallow subsurface layers. The results show that the magnitude of aquifer temperature change is positively correlated with the degree of impervious area derived from the NDVI values (i.e., negatively correlated with the NDVI value with 0.5–0.7°C warming for a 0.12NDVI difference at a 20-m depth). The relationship between aquifer temperature changes and grid-averaged NDVI values was strongest at an area of approximately 99,225m2 (roughly equal to an area with a 175-m radius) and determination coefficient equal to 0.91 for the Kanto plain. As the average area is further increased, the relationship between the two variables gradually became weaker. According to results verified for the Sendai and Chikushi plains, the same relationship was achieved for areas no larger than 175 (±15)m radius and a determination coefficient of 0.81, which is suggested as the operational spatial scale to determine the UHI effect on subsurface thermal regimes. As the necessity for adaptation measures to cope with urban thermal pollution is increasingly understood, the lateral extent of subsurface heat flow found in this study may be useful in urban planning and habitat restoration programs.

Spatial analysis of multisource remote sensing and plant diversity plots data were conducted using linear mixed effects models and structural equation models. Results revealed that the distribution of plant diversity in the watershed is mainly affected by human disturbance. However, under similar human disturbance levels, hydrologic elements also affect the plant diversity within the watershed. The topographic undulation and surface runoff significantly promote plant diversity, while the river network density, the watershed shape factor, the river longitudinal gradient do not. The influence of topographic undulation is more obvious than that of runoff on plant diversity, but the effect of topographic undulation and runoff on plant diversity is getting weaker from upstream to downstream within the watershed. In addition, the impact of hydrologic elements on plant diversity is mainly regulated by environmental factors Pre and Tem. The findings clarify how human disturbance and hydrologic elements affect plant diversity distribution within the watershed, optimizing the conservation theory of plant diversity resources and scientifically guiding the region's sustainable development.

AB  - Coastal wetlands play a vital role in coastline protection. Coastal landscape of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) has changed drastically. In order to explore the process and law of coastal landscape dynamics in GBA, in this research, multi-temporal Landsat images and proposed hybrid object-based image analysis and multi-level decision tree classification were applied to monitor the changing trends and current status of the coastal landscape in GBA from 1988 to 2018. There were 5818.58 km2 of natural wetlands in 2018, including mangroves (39.62 km2), tidal flats (73.64 km2), rivers (161.65 km2), and shallow seas (5543.67 km2). Due to the influence of anthropogenic activities, natural wetlands showed a decreasing trend, while artificial wetlands and non-wetlands have been increasing. Results indicated that the landscape in the study area showed a trend of fragmentation, the degree of landscape aggregation weakened, the dominant patches were scattered, the shape became more and more complex, and the landscape heterogeneity increased. Then, a future land use simulation model was used to simulate the coastal landscape change trends of GBA in 2028 under four scenarios. The mangrove has the fastest growth rate of 1.47 km2/a under wetland protection scenario. The tidal flat and paddy field would increase under scenarios of the wetland protection and farmland protection, respectively. The construction land has the fastest growth rate under the economic development scenario and would be 47.56 km2/a. Woodland, dry land, and culture ponds are further transformed into other landscape types, while rivers, shallow seas, and reservoirs/ponds have no obvious change.

AB  - Monitoring forests with satellite, remote sensors, and terrestrial measurements are active due to the forests’ great ecological and economic importance. The subject of our research is the reflectance of deciduous and coniferous forests, based on the results of terrestrial measurements by a spectroradiometer in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) of 400–700 nm. One of the tasks is to show the reflectance of forest vegetation with continuous smooth curves obtained by constructed cubic splines. Interval mathematics was also used as mathematical support for obtaining the continuous representation of the center reflectance values and comparison with corresponding mean values of reflectance given by the spectroradiometer. The field of research is the Pester plateau, which represents the center of biodiversity in terms of richness and diversity of forest vegetation. Their center reflectance values higher than the corresponding values obtained using the spectroradiometer have been researched. Factor analysis of the reflectance of forests has been performed and two factors have been separated. This paper aims to find a mathematical model of forest reflection analysis that facilitates forest classification and, based on the range of the reflection, assessments the health status of the forest.

AB  - Mapping inundation areas and flood depths is necessary for coastal and riverine management and planning. Flood maps help communicate flooding risk to affected communities and vulnerable populations and are essential for evaluating flooding impacts. Here, we introduce MatFlood, a computationally efficient static flood tool that exploits image-processing algorithm for estimation of flood extension and depth. Features include (a) an algorithm that evaluates hydro-connectivity; (b) functionality to calculate spatially varying flood water levels and (c) the inclusion of a reduction factor to mimic the effects of physical processes not explicitly resolved. The efficiency of the tool is well-suited for simulating numerous flooding maps using different inputs (flood water levels or digital elevation models), over large areas, and high spatial resolution. We apply MatFlood to assess the flood extent and depth of Hurricane Sandy (2012) in the New York/New Jersey area to illustrate its use. In comparison to existing approaches based on geographic information systems, MatFlood performs the same calculations six times faster in the Hurricane Sandy study case.

AB  - Boreal forests exert a strong influence on the permafrost dynamics protecting the landscapes under climate warming conditions. This paper discusses the influence of various vegetation types on permafrost temperature and active layer thickness, as well as changes in these parameters through successional stages of forest vegetation in Central Yakutia. Data from monitoring sites were used to examine the variability of permafrost conditions in different landscape types. Forest removal leads, on average, to an increase in ground temperature by 1°С and an increase in active layer thickness by 0.8–1 m, which may cause the melting of ground ice and surface subsidence. The recovery of the forest reduces the ground temperature and decreases the active layer thickness that's stabilizes the permafrost.

AB  - Growing season surface–atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide and methane were quantified at Fish Island, a wetland site in the lower northeast Mackenzie River Delta, Northwest Territories, Canada. The terrain consists of low-center polygonal tundra and is subject to infrequent flooding in high water years. Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes were continuously measured using eddy covariance and the relevance of different environmental controls were identified using neural networks. Net daily carbon dioxide uptake peaked in mid-July before gradually decreasing and transitioning to net daily emissions by September. Variations in light level and temperature were the main controls over diurnal net carbon dioxide uptake, whereas thaw depth and phenology were the main seasonal controls. Methane emissions measured at Fish Island were higher than comparable studies on river delta sites in the Arctic and were influenced by the interaction of a large number of factors including thaw and water table depth, soil temperatures, and net radiation. Spikes in methane emissions were associated with strong winds and turbulence. The Fish Island tundra was a net sink for carbon during the growing season and methane emissions only slightly reduced the overall sink strength.
Les échanges de dioxyde de carbone et de méthane entre la surface et l’atmosphère pendant la saison de croissance ont été quantifiés à Fish Island, une zone humide située dans le delta inférieur nord-est du fleuve Mackenzie, dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest, au Canada. Le terrain consiste en une toundra polygonale concave et il est sujet à des inondations occasionnelles lors des années de hautes eaux. Les flux de dioxyde de carbone et de méthane ont été mesurés en continu par covariance des turbulences et la pertinence des différents contrôles environnementaux a été examinée à l’aide de réseaux neuronaux. L’absorption quotidienne nette de dioxyde de carbone a atteint un pic à la mi-juillet avant de diminuer progressivement et de passer à des émissions quotidiennes nettes en septembre. Les variations du niveau de lumière et de la température constituaient les principaux contrôles de l’absorption diurne nette de dioxyde de carbone, tandis que la profondeur de dégel et la phénologie constituaient les principaux contrôles saisonniers. Les émissions de méthane mesurées à Fish Island étaient plus élevées que celles d’études comparables sur des sites de deltas fluviaux dans l’Arctique et elles étaient influencées par l’interaction d’un grand nombre de facteurs, y compris le dégel et la profondeur de la nappe phréatique, les températures du sol et le rayonnement net. Les pics d’émissions de méthane étaient associés à des vents forts et à de la turbulence. La toundra de Fish Island constituait un puits net de carbone pendant la saison de croissance et les émissions de méthane n’ont que légèrement réduit la force globale du puits.

AB  - Accurately assessing the biomass of tropical forests is a challenge for the scientific community. This study has determined the canopy height and above-ground biomass of Indian tropical forest plantation by the space-borne TanDEM-X Polarimetric Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data using the physical scattering model and machine learning. The complex coherence estimated using TanDEM-X datasets of December month was found most appropriate for inversion of canopy height. The best canopy height accuracy (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 1.66 m) was achieved by the TanDEM-X pair with vertical wavenumber (Kz) 0.18 at a 27.31° incidence angle in Random Volume over Ground model. The Random Forest model selects 12 optimal parameters from 42 variables (e.g. Canopy height, alpha angle, and coherence, etc.) for spatial prediction of AGB. Observed and predicted AGB showed R2 = 0.83 and RMSE = 27 Mg ha−1. The canopy height explained the maximum variation in AGB than other TanDEM-X variables in the ML algorithm.

AB  - Among photogrammetric products, orthophotos are probably the most versatile and widely used in many fields of application. In the last years, coupled with the spread of semi-automated survey and processing approaches based on photogrammetry, orthophotos have become almost a standard for monitoring the underwater environment. If on land the definition of the reference coordinate system and projection plane for the orthophoto generation is trivial, underwater it may represent a challenge. In this paper, we address the issue of defining the vertical direction and resulting horizontal plane (levelling) for the differential ortho rectification. We propose a non-invasive, contactless method based on roll and pitch angular data provided by in-camera IMU sensors and embedded in the Exif metadata of JPEG and raw image files. We show how our approach can be seamlessly integrated into automatic SfM/MVS pipelines, provide the mathematical background, and showcase real-world applications results in an underwater monitoring project. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and, for the first time, provide a metric evaluation of the definition of the vertical direction with low-cost sensors enclosed in digital cameras directly underwater.

AB  - Accurate information on wetland extent in East Asia is essential to assess progress towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the use of wetland resources, where wetlands benefit a quarter of the world's population and millions of wild birds in over three global migratory corridors. In this study, using 122,128 Sentinel-1 and 89,752 Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2021 available on the Google Earth Engine platform, we developed a novel two-stage classification for continental-scale wetland mapping and generated the first and up-to-date 10-m resolution wetland map of East Asia. Such a two-stage classification method, which integrates automatic sample generation and spatiotemporal features, combined an initial object-based random forest classifier with a subsequent hierarchical decision tree for secondary waterbody types. The resulting comprehensive map with 3 broad categories and 12 sub-categories in East Asia, named EA_Wetlands, achieved over 88% overall accuracy. According to EA_Wetlands, the total wetland area in this region is 481,802.49 km2, mainly distributed in Northeast China and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (41.02%). Of all wetlands in East Asia, about 68.26% are inland wetlands. The highest proportion (29.67%) is identified for inland marsh among 12 sub-categories. Among five countries, China has >88% of the total wetland resources in East Asia, followed by Mongolia (3.57%). South Korea has the largest ratio between wetland and national land areas (10.43%). EA_Wetlands, as the first 10-m resolution wetland data product, will have great applications and benefit wetland conservation and policy management. It will be a critical support for evaluating the implementation of wetland-related international conventions at country and continental scale in East Asia.

AB  - Negotiated solutions among contrasting land use interests in the nexus of water, energy, food and ecosystems require cooperation between actors with different viewpoints and backgrounds. We suggest aerial imagery and videos, captured by drones, to be “boundary objects”, easily interpretable landscape representations that might create a common understanding across stakeholders through their universal interpretability. We collected drone imagery and videos from different angles of a wide range of landscapes in Zambia, showing agricultural areas, forests, wetlands and water infrastructure. Then, we took the imagery back to the field to probe the perceptions of multiple stakeholders, including staff from both governmental and non-governmental organizations, hydropower operators, small- and large-scale farmers. In focus group discussions, we assessed the interpretability of oblique images, taken at an angle by a video drone, compared to nadir (vertical) imagery from Google Earth and from a high-end mapping drone. We show that oblique images produced better identification results across all groups of stakeholders, but especially from small-scale farmers, suggesting this type of imagery is helpful to empower people who lack previous experience in interpreting nadir images. Overall, the appreciation of the aesthetic value and the perceived professional benefits of drone imagery are high, but technical and legal barriers impede a wider adoption of the technology. While we highlight ethical concerns and technical limitations, we suggest that conservationists and environmental planners could benefit from a critical use of affordable video drones so as to produce intuitive landscape representations useful for more effective multi-stakeholder collaborations.

AB  - Ecological regionalization is not only an abstraction of understanding nature but also a form of management guidance toward achieving environmental sustainability. The existing global ecoregion scheme successfully contributes to the conservation of global and regional biodiversity. As highlighted by the conceptual framework of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), an integrated understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem services is required. In this new age, we propose a concept of global ecological functional regionalization, which should be separated from the former idea of biogeographical regionalization. With the consideration of key geographical characteristics and ecosystem services, the views of global environmental change and human activities are included in this new framework. However, key questions still exist about the principles, indicators, methods and applications of a global ecological functional regionalization. In the next studies, global ecological regionalization should focus more on the uncertainties of spatial datasets and mathematical models.

AB  - In the intermountain western US, expansion of Pinyon (Pinus edulis) and Juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodlands (PJ) into grasslands and shrublands is a pervasive phenomenon, and an example of the global trend towards enhanced woody growth in drylands. Due to the perceived impacts of these expansions on ecosystem services related to biodiversity, hydrology, soil stability, fire prevention, and livestock forage, mechanical and chemical PJ reduction treatments have been a long-standing practice in the region. More recently, PJ reduction practices have come under enhanced public scrutiny, due to potential impacts on PJ-dependent wildlife, risk of erosion due to soil disturbance, and cost effectiveness due to variable rates of long-term success. Moreover, there is growing interest in understanding the biotic, abiotic, and management conditions under which PJ reduction treatments are effective. Here, we evaluated PJ reduction treatment outcomes leveraging large, curated databases of land treatments, new remotely sensed fractional cover time-series products, gridded climate and soils data, and analytical approaches adopted from the econometric literature. From 302 treatment events and 1569 distinct treatment polygons we found evidence that treatments reduced tree cover and largely increased shrub and perennial herbaceous cover for 10 or more years. However, treatments were also associated with increases in annual, likely non-native, herbaceous cover. Importantly, we noted treatment outcomes varied by landscape context, with some soil and geomorphic settings exhibiting consistent returns to pre-treatment conditions within 10–15 years, and others exhibiting more persistent changes in functional type composition. Despite the overall trends we observed, there was considerable unexplained variability in outcomes from treatment to treatment, highlighting the need for caution and attention to local geomorphic and biological context in planning future treatments.

AB  - ﻿Abstract
Coastal sand dunes are amongst the world’s most sensitive and dynamic landforms. Unfortunately, during the last thirty years, heavy anthropogenic alterations have been observed, encompassing the greater part of the Bulgarian Black Sea coast (BBSC), which has changed the land-sea interactions significantly. As a consequence, the depositional coast has shrunk to 131 km or 25% of the aggregate Bulgarian Black Sea shoreline length. Although our research reveals that 86% of BBSC dunes are included in the Natura 2000 network of protected sites established under the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC 1992), they are often heavily modified, subjected to environmental vandalism and destroyed due to mismanagement or lack of accurate information and prevention. These facts were the main reason for carrying out an inventory of the Bulgarian Black Sea coastal dune systems in 2021-2022. Our research aimed to identify all dune systems/sand dunes, update their spatial distribution and classify the observed coastal sand dunes landforms along the BBSC. The article demonstrates a successful methodology for combining unmanned aerial systems (UAS), Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, in situ sediment sampling, video imaging and verification and GNSS-RTK ground control points for coastal mapping. As of June 2022, over 97% of the Bulgarian shoreline has been surveyed with this technique, excluding military areas and national security sites. Based on the acquired data, as of 2021, the shoreline length was estimated to be 518.7 km at a scale 1:5000. The integrated UAS approach includes using Digital surface models (DSM), raster orthophotomosaics (OM) and 3D models, based on SfM photogrammetry to analyse the coastal topography, detect dune forms and update their spatial distribution. Throughout the inventory, 46 beach-dune systems were identified along the BBSC, which were divided into 62 dune sectors. The area of coastal dune systems was estimated at 988.21 ha (0.0089% of Bulgaria) and a total length of 73 km (14% of the shoreline). A comprehensive geomorphological analysis of the relationships between landforms morphology, aeolian and morphodynamic processes, vegetation density and type was the basis for the coastal dune landforms (CDLs) or dune systems to be classified into primary (312 ha; 32%) and secondary (676 ha; 68%). Additionally, the CDLs were classified according to Natura 2000 habitats: fixed (grey) dunes (546.27 ha; 55.28%), wooded dunes (222.61 ha; 22.53%), shifting (white) dunes (150.30 ha; 15.21%), embryonic dunes (68.3 ha; 6.91%) and humid dune slacks (0.94 ha; 0.09%). The highest positioned CDLs on the Balkan Peninsula were registered at perched Sozopol Sand Dunes (61 m a.s.l.) and cliff-top dunes at Arkutino (50.2 m a.s.l.). The multi-temporal analysis of photogrammetric DSMs and raster OMs showed the permanent loss of five dune systems in the Pomorie-Burgas-Rosenets coastal sector. The accrued UAS data approach allowed us to identify and map eight dune systems for the first time: Zlatni Pyasatsi (Panorama), Asparuhovo (Varna), Byala, Atanasovska Kosa, Central Beach (Burgas), Chernomorets, Kavatsite (partly) and Rezovo-Kastrich. A high anthropogenic footprint was registered on 50.7 ha (5.1%) of the entire dune surface. In the final stage of the study, human interventions that caused degradation and permanent loss of dunes (12 ha) over the last 15 years along the BBSC were shown. The main causes for dune degradation along BBSC have been documented, such as massive tourism development after the socialist period, road construction, recreational pressure exerted on the dunes, human trampling, lack of designated footpaths in areas with fixed and mobile dunes, off-road vehicles and parking lots (especially at camping sites), dumping of garbage and anthropogenic marine litter on the sand dunes etc.

AB  - The eco-environment of the arid area is constantly fragile global-wide. The study on the spatial and temporal variation of its landscape pattern can quickly identify the driving factors, which is an effective analysis method of ecological conservation in the arid area. In this study, Jinghe County, Xinjiang, in Northwestern China, is chosen as a case study of understanding the major driving force of the oasis landscape. Landsat satellite images of 1994, 2007, and 2017 are used as the basic data sources for analysis. The moving window method, transition matrix, and factor analysis are selected as the main technical means for this paper to reveal the temporal and spatial variation of landscape pattern in Jinghe County, and to quantitatively describe its driving factors. The results of the analysis show that: (1) The landscape pattern of Jinghe County has changed dramatically, especially the construction land and farmland. Both show an increase of 351.29% and 269.01% respectively between 1994 and 2017. Farmland increased the most, with the proportion of 6.45% in Jinghe County, and expanded along with the “triangle” three sides. The area of forest land increased slightly, the area of grassland and unused land decreased, and the area of water did not change significantly. (2) The dominant obvious regional differences of landscape types in Jinghe County are mainly manifested in farmland and forest land. Taking the unused land as the boundary, the biodiversity of farmland decreased, and the aggregation degree deepened, while the fragmentation degree of forest land increased. (3) The spatial–temporal variation of landscape patterns in Jinghe County is the result of the combination of natural and human factors, but the correlation between human factors and the change of landscape area is significantly greater than that of natural factors. Thus, human factors are the main driving force of landscape pattern change in Jinghe County. The scientific management and planning of the intensity of human activities in Jinghe County should be the focus of ecological environment restoration and protection.

AB  - Groundwater is critical in supporting current and future reliable water supply throughout Africa. Although continental maps of groundwater storage and recharge have been developed, we currently lack a clear understanding on how the controls on groundwater recharge vary across the entire continent. Reviewing the existing literature, we synthesize information on reported groundwater recharge controls in Africa. We find that 15 out of 22 of these controls can be characterised using global datasets. We develop 11 descriptors of climatic, topographic, vegetation, soil and geologic properties using global datasets, to characterise groundwater recharge controls in Africa. These descriptors cluster Africa into 15 Recharge Landscape Units for which we expect recharge controls to be similar. Over 80% of the continents land area is organized by just nine of these units. We also find that aggregating the Units by similarity into four broader Recharge Landscapes (Desert, Dryland, Wet tropical and Wet tropical forest) provides a suitable level of landscape organisation to explain differences in ground-based long-term mean annual recharge and recharge ratio (annual recharge / annual precipitation) estimates. Furthermore, wetter Recharge Landscapes are more efficient in converting rainfall to recharge than drier Recharge Landscapes as well as having higher annual recharge rates. In Dryland Recharge Landscapes, we found that annual recharge rates largely varied according to mean annual precipitation, whereas recharge ratio estimates increase with increasing monthly variability in P-PET. However, we were unable to explain why ground-based estimates of recharge signatures vary across other Recharge Landscapes, in which there are fewer ground-based recharge estimates, using global datasets alone. Even in dryland regions, there is still considerable unexplained variability in the estimates of annual recharge and recharge ratio, stressing the limitations of global datasets for investigating ground-based information.

AB  - Coastal barrens support varied vegetation that includes wetlands, dwarf shrublands, and small patches of forest. Forest expansion, sea-level rise and recreational trails affect plant communities but spatial vegetation patterns within barrens are unknown. Using high-resolution multispectral aerial imagery, we classified plant communities and other land cover types using 500 m x 500 m landcover maps at three coastal barrens sites on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. Community patches were compared using size and shape metrics; shared edge length identified adjacent communities. Community distributions were modelled using environmental variables such as elevation and distance to coast. Forty distinct plant communities were detected, with shrublands (37.5 % total area), dwarf shrublands (23.3 %) and bog wetlands (13.9 %) the most abundant. Average patch size was 9.2 m2; average patch density was 951 patches/ha, indicating fine scale community variability. Recreational vehicle trails occurred primarily in bog wetlands. Dwarf shrublands and some wetland types were closest to the coastline; taller shrublands and tree islands occurred further from the coast. Edge relationships revealed a vegetation height gradient across the forest-barren ecotone: tree islands were mostly adjacent to tall shrub communities, followed by progressively shorter vegetation. Topographic variability and distance to coast were important predictors of community distribution. Edge relationships among communities allowed identification of those most at risk from trail disturbance, forest expansion and coastal squeeze.

AB  - Bovine livestock is a major anthropogenic greenhouse gas source via enteric methane. Brazilian bovine livestock is also responsible for emissions from land-use changes. In contrast, enteric emissions from extensive cattle systems in wetlands might have been overestimated. We provide scientific evidences that the human footprint of bovine products delivered by the Pantanal can be much lower. To assess this, a historical cloud-free imagery of the Landsat-5, spanning 26 years, were processed for mapping spatiotemporal landscapes in a Pantanal farm under cattle intensification studies. Eight landscape categories were identified according to spatiotemporal dynamics of interannual floods. The spatiotemporal map allowed in the field the adoption of stratified random samplings of chamber gas fluxes. The combination of stratified sampled landscapes with Monte Carlo simulations of measured methane emissions in wet and dry soils permitted to integrate landscapes emissions at annual basis with biased uncertainties. Assuming enteric emissions obtained for the Pantanal region, our results suggest that the landscapes methane emissions are 10- to 23-fold superior than the enteric emissions of traditional bovine systems. While enteric emissions seem negligible with respect to net farmland emissions, cattle livestock provide important environmental services like carbon recycling through non-competing herbivory. Moreover, cattle might be making use of a biomass that would undergo decomposition during the flooding phase. Our analysis thus indicate that enteric emissions from traditional bovine systems in flooding farmlands could be considered neutral. By contrast, intensification to improve the stocking rate should be accounted as net anthropogenic emissions. A case study of intensification allowed an increase of 48% in the stocking rate, which is associated with net anthropogenic emissions from 534 bovine animals or about 27 to 63 Mg of enteric CH4 per year. In short, the competition between traditional and distinct levels of cattle intensification will result from a trade-off between public policies and strategic market niches (organic, sustainable) for the optimal landscape management of the Pantanal.

AB  - Soil erosion and sediment delivery models have been increasingly employed in studies of catchment sediment dynamics in current years. These models are also used to represent the spatial interaction of soil erosion and sediment transport processes, thereby providing spatially-distributed predictions of soil redistribution rates for agricultural landscapes. It has been widely recognized that individual soil erosion processes and their interactions contribute towards total soil erosion; however, quantifying the rates and patterns of soil erosion processes and their interactions within topographically complex landscapes is challenging. Therefore, the objective of this research was to estimate and model the relative contributions of tillage, water and wind erosion towards total soil erosion in the Canadian Prairie provinces of Manitoba and Alberta using 137Cs, a fallout radionuclide tracer, and three well-established models: (i) Tillage Erosion Model (TillEM); (ii) Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, version 2 (RUSLE2); and (iii) Single-event Wind Erosion Evaluation Program (SWEEP). The findings indicate that the patterns of 137Cs-estimated soil erosion were closely matched with the erosion pattern predicted by TillEM and suggests that tillage erosion dominates the pattern of total soil erosion on the knolls of hummocky landscapes. Additionally, soil particle size variation within the wetland catchments reflected the modeled patterns of water and tillage erosion. Furthermore, our findings confirmed that colour coefficients are useful in identifying spatial heterogeneity of soil within wetland catchments and reflect the patterns of soil loss and gains. These results indicate that water and tillage erosion, and also their interactions, are main erosion processes in the Canadian Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), but that soil movement by tillage practices has been the predominant redistribution process.

AB  - Land degradation monitoring and assessment in the Sahel zone has relied substantially on temporal trends of remote sensing-based vegetation indices, which are proxies for the bioproductivity of the land. However, prior studies have shown that negative or positive trends in bioproductivity are not necessarily associated with degradation or improvement of land condition. In this short communication, while acknowledging the contributions of remote sensing-based indices and global-scale datasets to dismantling an outdated desertification narrative, we argue that local land users have much to contribute to our understanding of land degradation, and particularly to ensuring that scientific assessments of degradation capture variables relevant to them. We used the participatory photo elicitation method in three sites in the Senegalese Ferlo in order to elicit local pastoralists' perspectives on land degradation and identify the indicators that they use to characterize pasture quality, while empowering them to lead the discussion. The discussion revealed indicators far beyond bioproductivity, including livestock performance as well as composition and quality of the herbaceous and woody vegetative cover, invasive species, soil quality and water availability. We found that the pastoralists’ knowledge and interest in the issue could potentially be harnessed more systematically, and at larger scales, in order to build a spatially explicit field-based knowledge base of land degradation complementary to remote sensing-based maps of trends in bioproductivity. Such a dataset could serve as a standalone product or as a reference dataset for development and validation of remote sensing-based indicators.

AB  - Biological connectivity plays a cricial role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function. However, it is poorly understood how to quantify biological connectivity and investigate its mechanisms in estuarine wetlands. In order to address this issue, this study aims to quantify biological connectivity in the Liaohe Delta wetland by utilizing three complementary approaches: the habitat quality simulation, the vegetation connectivity index, and the maximum entropy model. These approaches focused on habitat quality, vegetation, and bird species, respectively. The established criteria for assessing vegetation connectivity blockage and the jackknife method were utilized to identify the primary drivers of biological connectivity. The study found that (1) Habitat quality declined from 1976 to 2020, with a total decrease of 3.2 × 106. (2) Vegetation patches have more fragmented and less connected over the last 45 years. There was also a higher vegetation probability density of Phragmites australis than Suaeda salsa. The area of unchanged P. australis was concentrated within the nature reserve, while the area of unchanged S. salsa was 0, indicating that P. australis was more affected than S. salsa. The vegetation connectivity blockage was 33.16%, with human activities having a greater impact compared to natural succession. (3) The area of suitable habitat for birds constituted 27.48% of the study area. Distance to S. salsa was the main driving factor, followed by the distance to intertidal muds, paddy fields, P. australis, and water sources. The results demonstrate that biological connectivity has generally declined over time, with human activities being a significant contributor. Our efforts to quantify biological connectivity provided clear spatial and temporal information on the trends and drivers of biological connectivity in the Liaohe Delta wetland. The results of this study can provide valuable information for conservation efforts aimed at preserving wetland biodiversity.

AB  - The Critical Zone is undergoing constant change due to climatic, lithospheric, and anthropogenic forcing factors. It is widely recognized that an integrated multidisciplinary approach to studying the Critical Zone is required to identify key variables, characterize process mechanics, study scale dependencies, and model various system dynamics. Geospatial technologies that include the fields of remote sensing, geomorphometry, and geocomputation will play an ever increasing role in studying the highly coupled complex systems of the Critical Zone. We provide fundamental background information on the role of geospatial technology for data collection, information extraction, and numerical modeling of landscape conditions; present a new spatio-temporal surface irradiance model, and highlight the use of a geocomputational approach that represents expert knowledge; integrates surface biophysical and topographic information, and provides a framework for studying landscape–subsurface relationships. Our results demonstrate the significance of geospatial technologies for the study and prediction of parameters and concepts that characterize the complexities of the Critical Zone.

AB  - Habitats of freshwater cetaceans are under increasing threats of deterioration globally. A complete understanding of long-term variations of habitat configurations is therefore critical. Poyang Lake in China contains a large and stable population of the Yangtze finless porpoise, a critically endangered freshwater cetacean species. However, constant water decline and intensified human activities in the lake since 2000 have led to uncertainty for porpoise conservation. We address this issue via remote sensing and hydrodynamic modeling of nine environmental variables during different seasons over the past two decades. The MaxEnt model was used to extrapolate changes in likely habitat configurations of the porpoise, and MARXAN algorithms delineated habitat protection priorities in different seasons. Results illustrate that flow velocity, water depth, Chl-a concentration, distance to grassland and boats greatly affect the porpoise distribution. Shifts in these environmental variables can lead to significant habitat decreases in all seasons. In particular, unstable hydrological regimes may force the porpoises to live in habitats with lower water depths for suitable flow velocity conditions in the dry season, and habitats are increasingly infringed by grassland and mudflats. High protection priority areas such as the northern channel and the estuaries of the tributaries urgently need long-term systematic and targeted surveys of ecosystem functionality and flexible management of anthropogenic activities. Combining remote sensing with hydrodynamic and species distribution models can also assist in understanding the situation of other aquatic species.

AB  - Forests are increasingly recognized for their role, importance and multifunctionality in terms of provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services they provide. Even if timber production remains the most economically valuable provisioning service in Primiero, the importance of and need for multifunctionality of forests is acknowledged. This article analyses the development of Forest Ecosystem Services (FES) governance innovation strategies by the Provincial Forest Agency as a policy entrepreneur in the area of Primiero, in Trentino, northeast of Italy. Based on detailed case study material, we create the heuristic of Kingdon’s three streams model in order to reconstruct the development of and negotiations around the introduction of innovative approaches to the problem, policy and politics levels and to identify the chosen or missed windows of opportunity to deliver innovation in FES management. Findings show that the main issues perceived by the local stakeholders concern loss of biodiversity, of cultural identity and historical landscape values. The policy-entrepreneurial initiatives undertaken by the Forest Agency represent a governance mix of direct project execution, financial incentives, organisational incentives and information-based activities. The results highlight its efforts to move beyond the traditional top-down approach based on widely available public funds and towards coordination and collaborations among stakeholders, contribution of private investments, bureaucracy simplification and interconnection between participatory and institutional processes.

AB  - The use of pellets as a replacement for firewood has been promoted in Chile to mitigate atmospheric pollution. However, their high demand has generated stock shortages, which has motivated the search for alternative sources of feedstock. Furthermore, invasive shrubs are a highly available biomass source for bioenergy production in central-southern Chile and may be a significant factor contributing to the spread and increasing virulence observed in wildfires across the region. This study aimed to determine the change in wildfire indicators related to the removal of invasive shrubs in selected zones in the Biobío region and to assess the physicochemical properties of the extracted biomass to develop a pellet formulation to produce a material conforming to ISO standards. The biomass management of Teline monspessulana, Ulex europaeus, and Rubus ulmifolius was evaluated using a fire simulation tool in three areas with contrasting physio-climatic conditions. Our simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of shrub management on three critical wildfire indicators. Namely, significant decreases were observed in fireline intensity (kW/m) 58–75%, flame length (m) 0–40%, and heat per unit area (kW/m2) 86%. Furthermore, a biomass quality index (BQI) was developed based on the physicochemical parameters of the three shrubs assessed. Based on this BQI, T. monspessulana was selected as the most promising shrub biomass and was consequently used in a pilot shrub-pinewood blending to produce pellets. A blending of 20:80%m/m exhibited properties close to the ISO standard. Our results show that the management of invasive shrubs has the potential to minimize the virulence of wildfires, while the physicochemical characteristics and availability of one of the shrubs analyzed (T. monspessulana) make it a viable alternative biomass source for pellet production in the region.

AB  - As 2021 saw the launch of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, it highlighted the need to prepare for success over the decade and to understand what public economic and financial incentives exist to support sustainable forest and landscape restoration. To date, Initiative 20 × 20, a coalition of 18 Latin American countries, has committed to place 50 million hectares under restoration and conservation by 2030. Understanding the public policies in these countries that turn those commitments into action, however, is very labor-intensive, requiring decision makers to read and analyze thousands of pages of documents that span multiple sectors, ministries, and scales that lie outside of their areas of expertise. To address this, we developed a semi-automated policy analysis tool that uses state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to mine policy documents, assist the labeling process carried out by policy experts, automatically identify policies that contain incentives and classify them by incentive instrument from the following categories: direct payments, fines, credit, tax deduction, technical assistance and supplies. Our best model achieves an F1 score of 93–94% in both identifying an incentive and its policy instrument, as well as an accuracy of above 90% for 5 out of 6 policy instruments, reducing multiple weeks of policy analysis work to a matter of minutes. In particular, the model properly identified the relative frequency of credits, direct payments, and fines that exist as the primary policy instruments in these countries. We also found that tax deductions, supplies, and technical assistance are much less used among most of the countries and that, oftentimes, the policy documents describe economic incentives for restoration in vague and intangible terms. In addition, our model is designed to constantly improve its performance with more data and feedback from policy experts. Furthermore, while our experiments were run on Spanish policy documents, we designed our framework to be widely scalable to policies from different countries and multiple languages, limited only by the number of languages supported by current multilingual NLP models. Using a standardized approach to generate incentives data could provide an evidence-based and transparent system to find complementarity between policies and help remove barriers for implementers and policymakers and enable a more informed decision-making process.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) continues to be a difficult process to estimate in seasonal and long-term water balances in catchment models. Approaches to estimate ET typically use vegetation parameters (e.g., leaf area index [LAI], interception capacity) obtained from field observation, remote sensing data, national or global land cover products, and/or simulated by ecosystem models. In this study we attempt to quantify the uncertainty that spatial evapotranspiration estimation introduces into hydrological simulations when the age of the forest is not precisely known. The Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM) was implemented for the Lysina headwater catchment, located 50°03′N, 12°40′E in the western part of the Czech Republic. The spatial forest patterns were digitized from forest age maps made available by the Czech Forest Administration. Two ET methods were implemented in the catchment model: the Biome-BGC forest growth sub-model (1-way coupled to PIHM) and with the fixed-seasonal LAI method. From these two approaches simulation scenarios were developed. We combined the estimated spatial forest age maps and two ET estimation methods to drive PIHM. A set of spatial hydrologic regime and streamflow regime indices were calculated from the modeling results for each method. Intercomparison of the hydrological responses to the spatial vegetation patterns suggested considerable variation in soil moisture and recharge and a small uncertainty in the groundwater table elevation and streamflow. The hydrologic modeling with ET estimated by Biome-BGC generated less uncertainty due to the plant physiology-based method. The implication of this research is that overall hydrologic variability induced by uncertain management practices was reduced by implementing vegetation models in the catchment models.

AB  - Coal remains a pivotal energy source, meeting 27 % of global energy demand and 70 % of India's energy requirements. However, coal mining significantly disrupts land use, necessitating effective reclamation strategies. This study examines the repercussions of coal mining on land use disruption and assesses the benefits of revegetation on structural attributes, biomass, carbon sequestration, and soil restoration in central India. Utilizing Landsat 9 satellite imagery, we characterized land use and vegetation dynamics, employing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to classify five distinct age sequence classes with median ages of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 years. Results indicated a decrease in tree density from 1408 to 588 trees per hectare as plantations aged from 5 to 40 years, while the basal area increased from 5.88 to 28.25 m2 per hectare. Notably, values in 40-year-old stands approached those of natural forests. Key novelties include the identification of a strong correlation between spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and soil quality indicators, providing a remote-sensing-based framework for monitoring ecological restoration. Both total standing biomass and carbon stock exhibited significant (p ≤ 0.05) increases with plantation age, ranging from 10.25 to 66.41 Mg ha−1 and 5.16 to 32.74 Mg ha−1, respectively. Soil carbon content decreased with depth, with values ranging from 7.68 to 18.98 Mg ha−1 at 0–20 cm depth, and soil nitrogen values spanning 82.66 to 216.08 kg ha−1. These findings underscore the necessity of site-specific management strategies that integrate technological, ecological, and economic considerations to advance ecological restoration and align with the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

AB  - Ecological impact assessments are undertaken in compliance with legislative mandates to evaluate the effects of proposed habitat modification. This task becomes complex when evaluating the impacts on highly mobile species like apex predators. Despite their importance to ecosystem function, environmental policies may inadequately protect apex predator habitat. Here we provide a case study that examines the efficacy of legislation and impact assessment tools in protecting habitat for a wide-ranging and threatened apex predator. The high resource requirements of apex predators, and their utilisation of large areas of high-quality habitat make them ideal conservation surrogates for other less resource demanding species, and as such good case studies in assessing the effectiveness of policy. The powerful owl (Ninox strenua) occurs across many landscape types throughout its distribution, including large tracts of private property and public landholdings, making this species difficult to assess through impact assessments. To examine the level of legislative protection for powerful owls, and how well their habitat use is captured, we compared GPS tracking data to environmental policy and industry impact assessment tools. We found that legislation has limited potential to protect powerful owl habitat and owls are likely dismissed from impact assessments due to their cryptic and wide-ranging behavioural traits. The existing legislative safeguards seem inadequate, and these shortcomings are likely contributing to species decline. There is a critical need for policy to be applicable to both public and private land tenure, and for legislation and impact assessment tools to incorporate research data for effective conservation and management.

AB  - The effects of spatial pattern of urban greenspace on land surface temperature (LST) have been extensively documented. Previous studies have confirmed that the relationship between urban green spatial pattern and LST is sensitive to spatial resolution and remote sensing imagery with higher resolution could be more accurate on quantifying the urban green patterns, but little is known about another scaling issue—spatial extent. This paper examined whether the spatial extent applied to derive landscape metrics affect the relationship between LST and spatial pattern of urban forested areas of highly urbanized Shanghai and the seasonal variations using correlation analyses and regression analyses. Spatial pattern of forested areas was measured with eight class-level landscape metrics over four spatial extents/scales (90 m × 90 m, 180 m × 180 m, 360 m × 360 m and 720 m × 720 m) using moving-window approach based on a land-use and land cover (LULC) map derived from SPOT 6 datasets. Results demonstrated that changing spatial extent had significant impacts on the relationship between spatial pattern of urban forested areas and LST. The responses of correlations between spatial pattern metrics and LST to changing extent fell into three categories: correlation decreases with extent increases, correlation increases with extent increases and unpredictable pattern. In general, the amount of forested cover accounts for greater variability in LST than its spatial arrangement. This study extended our scientific understanding of the effects of spatial pattern of urban forested area on LST. In addition, it can provide insights for urban forest planning and management.

AB  - The landscape naturalness may be defined and analysed by various concepts and methods attempting to encapsulate as much as possible the degree of natural conditions over a given territory. The Machado Index (MI) was developed by the Spanish biologist Antonio Machado and uses a qualitative approach to naturalness, being characterized by its versatile application throughout different environments. The outcome of the expert-based evaluation is a score that corresponds to various degrees of naturalness. This research aims to turn the MI into a semi-objective tool, introducing land cover and the ‘neighbouring to natural’ criteria as quantitative components. The MI was applied for assessing the landscape naturalness over Romania, as a case-study, and the Expert Opinion Classification (EOC) method was performed in order to identify the primary benefits and limitations of the MI. Further, the study uses the Principle of Naturalness Spatial Gradient (PNSG) as the basis for conceiving a new approach, named the Edge Contrast method (ECON). The assessment of naturalness consists in the usefulness of a previous Landscape Ecology metric, the Edge Contrast Index (ECI). We finally propose a third method, encompassing the advantages of the prior two, named the Enhanced Machado Index (EMI). The main result of this study is an enhanced method which can be used for assessing the degree of naturalness in a semi-objective manner. A set of three examples taken from different areas of Romania are assessed in a comparative analysis in order to highlight the differences between the EOC, ECON and EMI methods. The EMI results are validated by comparison with different databases.

AB  - The vulnerability of Bangladesh to frequent flash floods during monsoon seasons is evident by the recent severe impacts experienced in Sylhet and Sunamganj. The main aim of this chapter is to conduct a thorough assessment of flood inundation across the region. This study analyzes the Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar data to derive flood extents on the Google Earth Engine platform, and 2021 census population datasets along with 10m land use and land cover are used to estimate the flood-affected population and agricultural lands. The composite flood inundation analysis indicates that around 152,253 and 210,670ha of Sylhet and Sunamganj were flooded, affecting approximately 3,849,638 and 2,690,150 people, respectively. Moreover, the research shows that the most adversely affected land class was cropland, with moderate and high-intensity floods submerging most areas. The chapter provides essential information by identifying areas at high risk of flooding and estimating the potential impacts for immediate decision-making and early interventions.

AB  - Cultural and Natural Heritage (CNH) are both irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration, according to the UNESCO definition. Rural areas represent outstanding examples of cultural, either tangible or intangible, and natural heritage. While rural areas are facing a socio-economic and demographic crisis all over the world, CNH need not only to be safeguarded, but also promoted as a driver for competitiveness, growth and sustainable and inclusive development. This paper goes deeper into the study of computational methods (CMs) applied to modelling CNH in rural areas by looking at how computational methods can support CNH promotion and valorisation to transform rural areas into laboratories for the demonstration of sustainable development through improving the unique potential of their heritage. To this end, different computational methods have been studied and classified according to their scope and application area parameters, showing some correlation among the said parameters and the class of computational method. Apart from how CMs have been applied, wehether it is possible to scale up these CMs elsewhere has also been considered.

AB  - Wetlands are one of the most important ecosystems on the Earth, and using hyperspectral remote sensing (RS) technology for fine wetland mapping is important for restoring and protecting the natural resources of coastal wetlands. However, the high cost in collecting labeled samples and inconsistent acquisition conditions across different geographic regions or scenes lead to difficulties in wetland mapping and classification. To mitigate these difficulties, a spatial–spectral weighted adversarial domain adaptation (SSWADA) network is proposed for the cross-scene wetland mapping using hyperspectral image (HSI). The proposed SSWADA employs an idea of weighted adversarial discrimination to align the feature distribution of source and target scenes, where a generator or feature extractor with joint 2D–3D convolution is used to extract spatial–spectral features of HSI, a weighted discriminator is constructed to perform source instance weighting and a multi-classifier structure is designed to improve the classification performance on target samples. Experimental results on four different tasks show that our SSWADA outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for cross-scene wetland mapping.

AB  - Traditional Chinese villages are a successful example of active adaptation and effective use and protection of the environment. Traditional Chinese settlement landscapes form under the influence of geographical environments and environment-friendly ideas and have specific regional identities. Core factors of these residential areas can be considered cultural landscape genes. Based on this, this paper used gene analysis to identify traditional Chinese habitat patterns and decipher their environmental significance and cultural connotations. The results show that: Living patterns can be divided into six categories: ‘north-sitting or south-facing’, ‘Yin and Yang harmony’, ‘mountain-backed or water-facing’, ‘square-surrounded’, ‘psychological induction’, and ‘site-specific’ modes. These patterns correspond to the laws of orientation: Yin and Yang, mountain and water, security, auspiciousness, and synthesis, respectively. In their process of formation and development, traditional Chinese living patterns were deeply influenced by the traditional Chinese philosophical ideas of ‘Yin and Yang’, ‘the living earth’, ‘unity of heaven and human’, and ‘harmony between human and earth’. This study utilised the logical framework of gene identification, decoding, and expression to examine the characteristics and values of residential landscapes in traditional Chinese settlement patterns, and extracted the genome map of settlement pattern from a cross-regional perspective. This study has important implications for the construction of green habitats.

AB  - Mountain regions in Western Europe have gone through a massive rural–urban migration and the collapse of their traditional socioeconomic system. As a result, forest has occupied many old pastures and croplands. In protected areas – such as National Parks – changes in the landscape can affect biodiversity and other services, including the values that motivated their declaration. Any policy decision in these areas requires quantifying the extent and impact of land-cover changes and their consequences on landscape structure and functioning. In this study we analyze the patterns of change in forest cover during six decades in three mountain National Parks in Spain. Our aim is to quantify those patterns, their effects on the landscape, and discuss the potential consequences for the main natural values and services. We assessed changes in forest cover through reclassification of aerial ortophotographs taken in 1956–57 (past images) and 2016–17 (recent images). The three Parks show a relatively low change in total forest area (+5–10%), and a much larger increase in dense forest (+20–30%), with an important effect of land-use legacies, and similar patterns of landscape homogenization. There were fewer but larger forest patches in 2016 than in 1956, and most of the gain in dense forest occurred in core areas (+20%), while transition areas such as edges, bridges or loops decreased between 30 and 55%. Given their potential consequences on biodiversity and other services, these patterns of land-cover change and landscape configuration should be explicitly considered when designing the sustainable management of abandoned landscapes in protected areas.

AB  - The importance of collaboration among peers in science is widely investigated: an essential issue is the relevance of credits shared among scholars for the good faith and cooperation in research projects. Despite its significance, so far in Italy the usefulness of collaboration in research activities is not taken in due consideration by both scientific community and research assessment bodies. In this study, the main aim is at investigating the actual up today extent of scientific collaboration among colleagues belonging to the Italian Scientific Disciplinary Sector (SDS) “AGR10 Rural buildings and agro-forest land planning”. We focus on research projects dealing with territory, landscape and rural buildings with the scope of raising consciousness on the key role of collaboration with other SDSs, international institutions or organizations. We harvested data through an on-line questionnaire about several research projects, scrutinized the responses, and found that the core area of current research developed by AGR10 colleagues includes topics concerning the analysis and planning of landscape. Furthermore, we found that the design of international project proposals attains mostly rural buildings and rural heritage analysis, reuse and enhancement, rural buildings and landscape integration, and rural buildings design. While the size of partnerships on international research activities is still limited, as for external synergies the SDS AGR01 ‘Agricultural Economics and Rural Appraisal’ is the most representative, and other SDSs involving ‘Ecology’ and ‘Informatics’ deserve to be mentioned. So, this study has been designed with the secondary aim of stimulating Italian -as well as other international- scientific communities in promoting similar investigations concerning the importance of collaboration and cross-fertilization for successful research activities. As a major output, official national or international research assessment authorities would be provided by a method for better appreciating the usefulness of collaboration and interdisciplinarity.

AB  - Landscape reconstructions are subject to multiple filters. Nevertheless, they are the basis for scientific interpretations of the archaeological record. The resulting distribution maps in turn serve to create archaeological maps for the prediction of areas with a high archaeological vulnerability potential. This predictive modelling also leads to the classification of archaeological-free areas. However, the fact that this spatial classification was created on the basis of an archaeological database, which in turn is strongly biased by find densities in modern agglomerations, leads to the potential destruction of archaeological monuments that are located in the invulnerable periphery. Such potential maps can only be sharpened by integrating a large number of different methodical concepts. This article presents the comprehensive combination of satellite remote sensing data, GIS-based landscape analyses and environmental data sets for the construction of a potentially holistic landscape scenario. Only with the highest possible information density of a large-scale study area can interactions in the geographical control factors be identified and conclusions be drawn on archaeological land-use and settlement concepts.

AB  - Developing/developed cities have resulted in massive anthropogenic modifications of the environment through replacement of natural land cover with concrete, bricks, asphalt and metal. This reduces evapotranspiration, increases the heat storage and alters air movement. Consequently, many urban areas experience temperatures higher than their surrounding rural areas, turning them into Urban Heat Islands (UHI). Hyderabad, a Tier-1 Indian city has experienced significant land use land cover (LULC) changes during the last two decades (2001–2020) owing to rapid urbanization. This study investigates the urban growth and consequent changes in surface UHI (SUHI) intensity over this period using Landsat LULC, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) and Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Substantial LULC changes were observed during this period with the urban area increasing by 108.8%, but barren and grasslands decreasing by 27.2% and 27.0%, respectively. Vegetation showed a decreasing trend by 19.0% from 2001 to 2015, but an increase by 24.8% during the 2015 to 2020 period. Comparison with surrounding rural areas led to the conclusion that Hyderabad urban behaved as an surface Urban Cool Island (SUCI) during the daytime and as SUHI during the nighttime with higher LST regions concentrated within 0–15 km from the city center. The area from 20 to 25 km from the city center experienced the highest urban expansion in the last two decades.

AB  - Human influence on the environment differs in terms of distribution and intensity, thus producing a gradient of landscape modifications that translates into different landscape structures. Within this variety of landscapes, fringe areas represent complex spaces where dynamic processes and instable conditions can be observed. In this research Kernel Density Estimation, multivariate spatial analysis, landscape pattern analysis, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were combined to model and characterise landscape gradients, and to analyse the structural features of fringe areas. This methodology was applied to a rural area of central Italy, using density indicators associated with urbanisation, agriculture, and natural elements considered to be key components for the identification of landscape gradients. The results highlight not only specific “pillar” landscapes, which are dominated by said components, but also transitional landscapes, where the most relevant forms of interaction between land uses were identified. Characterisation of landscape structures along the gradient illustrated different trends in patch density, shape complexity and landscape diversity, demonstrating greater variability in fringe areas than in pillar landscapes. PCA revealed a partial overlap between the main structural characteristics of the agro-forestry matrix and the medium intensity agricultural landscapes, whereas urban fringes and semi-natural fringes were clearly separated. The discovery of the continuous landscape gradients and an understanding of the gamut of landscape types nested along them is crucial in allowing for more effective land-use planning in which also fringe areas become a relevant part of the process.

AB  - Biological control is affected by the composition of landscapes surrounding agricultural fields. Natural enemy communities are typically more diverse, and effective at providing biological control services, in complex compared to simple landscapes. However, the use of simple metrics to characterize landscapes, such as the proportion of agricultural habitat, obscures the mechanisms by which landscapes affect biological control. Studies that evaluate the overall complexity of agricultural landscapes, and their temporal variability, allow for a greater mechanistic understanding of the impacts of landscape composition on biological control. From an applied perspective, decision support systems, which deliver real-time information about pest and natural enemy populations, are an effective tool for delivering recommendations to strengthen biological control across space and time.

AB  - The forests in the Aysén region (ca. 43–49 °S, Chile) have a high degree of wilderness and cover more than 4.8 million hectares, making it one of the largest areas of subantarctic forest in the Southern Hemisphere. The impact of global warming on this region is poorly documented. The main objective of this work was to analyze the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST) and precipitation over Aysen forests in the context of ongoing global warming. We used average monthly images of LST and NDVI derived from the MODIS sensor covering the period 2001–2016 and precipitation from gridded datasets. The Aysén region was divided into three nested spatial scales: i) regional, ii) regional considering only forests, iii) local scale considering an evergreen subantarctic forest area covering around 5 × 5 km and a local deciduous forest area (dominated by Nothofagus pumilio). Trend analysis showed a warming rate of +0.78 K/decade (p ≤ 0.05) over the subantarctic forest zone, greening of +0.01/decade for NDVI (p ≤ 0.05) over the western zone, and a drying trend (p ≤ 0.05) over the eastern zone. The minimum temperature anomalies showed an increase of about 4.5 K during the period under analysis. LST, NDVI and precipitation were also analyzed here. The recent trends in temperature, greening and precipitation over the forests of Aysén detected in this research contribute to a better understanding of global warming impacts on subantarctic forests in the southern tip of South America. Nevertheless, to get a better estimation of the impact of global warming at multiple scales is needed to have better quality and quantity of data in situ.

AB  - Whether fresh or salty, water is a unique resource, a continuum interlinked by the hydrological cycle. It forms a complex system connected to the landscape. When the landscape is altered, water flows and their benefits are impacted. Degraded land compromises water resources. The governance and management of landscape and water resources are handled in a fragmented manner and in separate contexts. The Source-to-Sea approach offers an integrative vision based on systems thinking that focuses its concerns on the interaction among parts, flows, and processes. It proposes a framework for the governance and management of freshwater and marine water but does not bring the landscape into the context of the approach. This research used an analytical-deductive method to explore the interactions and connections between the Source-to-sea approach, landscape concepts and approaches, and the guidelines of the European Landscape Convention. The main objective was to identify and assess the feasibility of integrating these elements. The integration resulted in a governance and management approach termed the S2S Landscape approach. It is grounded in systems thinking, practical learning, active participation, and adaptive governance and management, providing an integrated vision between landscape and water. The approach includes four essential steps (Comprehension, Involvement, Planning, and Execution and Monitoring) that address the complex connections that freshwater and marine water maintain in the landscape, considering physical, biological, socio-environmental, and economic aspects across all segments, from the land to the open sea. This S2S Landscape approach may be the path to address the challenges of governance and sustainable management of resources in an interconnected and constantly changing world.

AB  - Increased attention has been paid to refining Local Climate Zone (LCZ) maps. However, the mapping process is difficult because of image resolution limitations and the lack of detailed planning data. To our knowledge for the first time, to promote the application of refined LCZ maps in urban climate research, we have proposed the downscaling mapping process by by integrating GIS workflow and remote sensing workflow. The results have shown that: (1) By adjusting the scale and input of the deep learning model, the LCZ basemap achieved the highest overall accuracy of 83.64% and the highest data matching degree of 0.71. (2) Visual interpretation showed that the overall accuracy of LCZ map at all scales is >70%, and the highest overall accuracy of 84.44% is achieved at 20 m scale. (3) Usefulness assessment showed that the LST levels of LCZs significantly differ at all scales (p < 0.01). The 160 m scale was the most suitable for analysis of the thermal characteristics of urban landscapes. This downscaling mapping method will help urban planners in developing urban climate models to determine the impact mechanisms of urban development and support progress in sustainable urban development efforts.

AB  - Forest land plays a vital role in global climate, ecosystems, farming and human living environments. Therefore, forest biomass estimation methods are necessary to monitor changes in the forest structure and function, which are key data in natural resources research. Although accurate forest biomass measurements are important in forest inventory and assessment, high-density measurements that involve airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) at a low flight height in large mountainous areas are expensive. The objective of this study was to quantify the aboveground biomass (AGB) of a plateau mountainous forest reserve using a system that synergistically combines an unmanned aircraft system (UAS)-based digital aerial camera and LiDAR to leverage their complementary advantages. In this study, we utilized digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP), which has the unique advantages of speed, high spatial resolution, and low cost, to compensate for the deficiency of forestry inventory using UAS-based LiDAR that requires terrain-following flight for high-resolution data acquisition. Combined with the sparse LiDAR points acquired by using a high-altitude and high-speed UAS for terrain extraction, dense normalized DAP point clouds can be obtained to produce an accurate and high-resolution canopy height model (CHM). Based on the CHM and spectral attributes obtained from multispectral images, we estimated and mapped the AGB of the region of interest with considerable cost efficiency. It is proved that sparse LiDAR point cloud could serve as important sources for terrain estimation. The accuracy of the AGB estimates could be improved by 9% and 5% in terms of the RMSE and R2, respectively, by adding spectral metrics to point cloud structural metrics. Compared with results obtained using only spectral metrics, the results obtained using the combination of spectral and point cloud metrics were better by 37% in terms of the RMSE and 55% in R2. Our study supports the development of predictive models for large-scale wall-to-wall AGB mapping by leveraging the complementarity between DAP and LiDAR measurements. This work also reveals the potential of utilizing a UAS-based digital camera and LiDAR synergistically in a plateau mountainous forest area. In this future, we will further investigate different establishing strategies for combining different sensors in a synergistic system.

AB  - Using imagery available through Google Earth Pro and a point sampling methodology, changes in land cover for three U.S. cities were assessed, beginning during the Great Recession (2007) and extending through to 2018. The cities were Buffalo (New York), Denver (Colorado), and San Diego (California), and 11 land cover classes were used to characterize each. The novel contributions of this work, and the innovative contributions to science include an analysis of urban land cover change in the years since the Great Recession, and the use of point pattern analysis on sample points that changed from non-developed in 2007 to developed in 2018, to determine whether a spatial pattern of land cover class change was evident. An initial assumption was made that forest cover change in these three cities would be minimal since the Great Recession. In fact, forest cover decreased by less than 1% in all three cities with the greatest decrease in Buffalo. Over the post-recession study period, increases in the developed land classes were evident in all three cities at the expense of grasses, tree cover, and other land classes. Some clustering of new development activities was noticed at a relatively small scale in San Diego, while some dispersion of new developed activities was noticed at a larger scale in Denver. Among other factors, changes in population, economics, and land use are factors that influence land cover change with specific impacts on forest cover, and therefore in the provision of urban forest benefits to the environment and society.

Diverse, reliable, and resilient networks of information, finance, and seedlings are essential for the restoration movement to be sustainable. The study identifies that key resource flows are not directly accessible to the farmers, who are the key implementers of restoration in Rwanda. The study identifies the need to first understand and then strengthen these networks by mapping actors’ resource flows, priorities and values, and then developing a strategy for change. By considering actor networks, restoration interventions can be more efficient regarding resources, collaboration and outreach. Moreover, conflicts and bottlenecks can be more easily anticipated.

AB  - One of the main threats to freshwater turtle populations is habitat destruction, which occurs as a result of human activities such as infrastructure development, forestry, aggregate extraction, and agriculture. However, the impacts of these activities on thermoregulatory opportunities for turtles are not well understood. We examined the impacts of forestry and aggregate extraction on thermal characteristics of wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) habitat in the Sudbury District, Ontario, by measuring the differences in absolute temperature, thermal landscape structure, and habitat thermal quality among relatively undisturbed sites (N = 2), harvested forestry sites (N = 2), and aggregate pits (N = 2) in 2015. We also tested the potential use of the thermal landscape concept as a predictor of habitat thermal quality. Undisturbed habitats were of higher thermal quality than impacted sites in terms of temperatures experienced in situ by wild wood turtles in their natural home ranges, and never reached temperatures that would be injurious to turtles (i.e., below CTMIN or above CTMAX). The undisturbed sites were of lower quality in terms of optimal temperatures (i.e., Tset), and were generally cooler and their temperatures less variable than those in impacted habitats. The thermal landscape concept provided a useful predictor of habitat thermal quality when the influence of time of day was factored into the predictive model. Our data are important to the conservation and management of wood turtles because they provide a preliminary quantification of the thermal impacts of natural resource extraction on the habitat of an endangered species, and can guide the development of mitigation and rehabilitation plans by providing measures of, and targets for, thermal habitat quality.

AB  - Photogrammetry is one of the most reliable techniques to generate high-resolution topographic data and it is key to territorial mapping and change detection analysis of landforms in hydro-geomorphological high-risk areas. Specifically, the Structure from Motion (SfM) is an emerging topographic survey technique that addresses the problem of determining the 3D position of image descriptors to estimate three-dimensional structures. Thanks to the potential of SfM algorithm and the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that allow the on-demand acquisition of high-resolution aerial images, it is possible to survey extended areas of the Earth surface and monitor active phenomena through multi-temporal surveys. However, the ability to detect remote and wide areas with a very high-resolution is countered by the need to capture large datasets which can limit the photogrammetric process, due to the need for high-performance hardware. This paper presents a photogrammetric workflow based on Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS), which is able to return different outputs and to manage a large amount of data in reasonable time, through the distribution of the most computationally expensive steps on computing clusters hosted by the ReCaS-Bari data center for scientific research. The results are given in terms of performance evaluations based on different computing configurations of the clusters and setups of the steps of the workflow. The HTC cluster test with a parallel SSH approach involved an important reduction of several hours in the processing time of thousands UAV images, especially compared to classic photogrammetric process on a single workstation with commercial software. A parallel test, aimed to validate the performance of a single sever of the new HPC cluster, involved really good results halving the processing time with respect to the HTC cluster test.

AB  - Comparative soil health studies are critical in soil conservation and gauging the success of different management practices in soil health improvement. A primary challenge in these studies is the selection of a consistent natural reference site. Current choices vary widely, from minimally disturbed areas to pristine prairies. This methodological paper underscores the need for deliberate and thoughtful reference site selection for benchmark soil properties. Utilizing the State &Transition models, the study introduces a framework for this selection, drawing upon the ecological site (ES) and reference plant communities detailed in an ecological site description (ESD) within a respective Major Land Resource Area (MLRA). This study advocates for a localized classification within the framework of the Cropland Reference Ecological Unit (CREU), emphasizing the significance of local precipitation and soil data to ensure unbiased comparisons. Soil samples from eastern (MLRA 106) and western (MLRA 67A) Nebraska were collected, representing distinct pedogenetic and climatic differences. Analysis of soil organic matter between MLRAs displayed substantial variations, suggesting potential biases and complexities in soil health gap calculations when using reference sites and croplands not in the same MLRA, soil types (texture class), or precipitation zones. However, refining the comparisons by delineating the MLRA, soil, and precipitation zones within the framework of CREU yielded more consistent and realistic comparative data. Integrating the MLRA and ES, complemented by granular soil and precipitation data, provides a robust method for establishing soil health benchmark data.

AB  - To effectively develop strategies that address the escalating surface temperatures of cities in diverse landscape characters, various and sometimes contradicting drivers are presented in the literature. A synthesis of findings and observations in this aspect is lacking. Therefore, the main tenet of our study was to identify robust landscape metrics (LMs) that drive the dynamics of urban land surface temperature (ULST) and analyse the extent to which landscape character influences their impact. We adopted a systematic literature review protocol, augmented with different geospatial datasets (at a global scale) and applied mixed approaches for our review and analyses. A total of 101 relevant articles were identified, although skewed towards Asia; various methods were utilised in analysing the LMs – ULST relationship; about 432 unique LMs were revealed with only 11 % of these confirmed to be robust. Landscape character elements are found to exert a slight to moderate significant influence on the LMs − ULST relationship reported in the literature. This further strengthened our proposition of the need to consider landscape character elements in understanding the dynamics of ULST in different environments. To this end, we developed an interactive scheme to synthesize our findings which reveal robust LMs in diverse landscape characters. Our FAIRly-open study serves as a call to the scientific community and urban stakeholders to engage and interact with our findings as this may help rethink (current) ULST mitigation strategies. Also, combining our scheme with expert and local spatial knowledge of stakeholders can offer a practical foundation for addressing ULSTs across diverse landscapes.

AB  - Recent reforestation programs have led to significant increases in forest cover in China; however, they have not been able to halt the process of forest fragmentation. The dynamics of forest fragmentation are still unknown, especially the transitions among forest core (FC), forest edge (FE), and non-forest areas. Taking Fujian Province in southeast China as a case, a new FE index (FEI) was proposed to identify FE, FC, forest patch (FP), matrix edge (ME), matrix core (MC), and forest perforation (FPe) as well. Then the transitions among FC, FE, and non-forest areas was explored; a series of logistic regression models were developed to examine the internal and external, static and dynamic driving patterns of the FE dynamics. The results revealed that the FEI outperforms conventional landscape metrics in identifying FE areas. During the period from 2000 to 2020, FE constituted approximately 41% of the study area. Frequent transition dynamics were observed between FE and other landscape types, accounting for 22% and 19% of the study area during 2000–2010 and 2010–2020, respectively. The internal driving models demonstrated that various landscape types exerted a negative influence on FE expansion. Among these, FPe emerged as a dominant factor, followed by MC, FC, and ME. The external models highlighted the significant influence of elevation, average annual temperature, distance from road, and slope on the mutual transition between FC and FE, while aspect and GDP influenced greatly on the transition from matrix to FE. These findings deepen the understanding of forest fragmentation dynamics and provide valuable insights for forest management.

AB  - Developing a reasonable landscape ecological risk (LER) assessment is crucial to establishing LER alert mechanisms and promoting ecological protection, environmental management and social development. The typical cross-border Koshi River Basin (KRB), which has a sensitive human-environment relationship, was the study area. Using the LER assessment model, we evaluated the LER of the KRB in 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2017 and analyzed its spatial-temporal evolution characteristics. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted to assess the clustering characteristics of the LER. The results showed the following: (1) The LER in the KRB showed a decreasing trend for 1990–2000 and an increasing trend for 2000–2017. High LER areas were mainly located on the border between China and Nepal, where the LER increased from 1990 to 2017. (2) The Nepal part of the KRB had the highest LER, and the Indian part had the lowest LER. As the slope increased, the extremely ecologically deteriorated areas generally increased. (3) The LER displayed a clustering characteristic in the KRB. High–high regions were distributed in extremely high LER regions, and low–low regions were located in extremely low and low LER regions. High human influence intensity was responsible for the increase in LER. Our study is valuable to the development and ecological security management of cross-border basins.

AB  - Rapid urbanization, particularly in developing countries, is widely regarded as one of the most critical global issues in the 21 st century. It is known to exacerbate urban heat island effects, a phenomenon that could affect the livability of cities and the lives and comfort of more than half of the world population who are now living in urban areas. The issue on how to mitigate the impacts of this phenomenon and help urban dwellers adapt to it, has been, and continues to be, an important topic in the context of landscape design and urban planning. This study sought to examine the cooling effects of different land cover types from the perspectives of landscape composition and configuration using Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data. Various spatial and statistical approaches, including urban-rural gradient, grid-based, landscape metrics, and scatter plot, were employed to analyze the derived land cover and land surface temperature (LST) maps. The results showed that both forest and water had a cooling effect during daytime in Hangzhou. The heat core in Hangzhou was situated close to the central business district and the variance in LST in urban and rural recorded at 3.22 ℃. The correlation of forest density with mean LST could be detected in both large (690 m) and small (210 m) grids, whereas the correlation of water density with mean LST was only observed in small grids. In general, forest with high aggregation and complex shape behave best in cooling LST while huge and complete water bodies had better cooling effect than scattered water patches. Besides, the minimum cooling scale of forest and water were proximately 120 m and 150 m from the cooling resources to the neighboring areas, respectively. The findings were considered valuable for urban planners to spatially and architecturally build and arrange the cooling land cover resources, eventually to fulfill the Chinese government’s new plan of building “livable cities”.

AB  - Urbanization is a global phenomenon that caused many regions worldwide to face dramatic Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes associated with urban sprawl and significant consequences. This research aims to assess and predict the urban growth of Peshawar city as well as LULC with a Cellular-Automata-Markov-Chain (CA-Markov-Chain). LULC distributions were mapped using Landsat (5, 7, and 8) data from 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018. Long-term changes to the landscape were simulated using a CA-Markov model at 10-year intervals from 2018, 2028 and 2038. Finally, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were used to validate the models and LULC maps accuracies. Results indicate a substantial expansion in built-up area and vegetation class for Peshawar city replacing bare land. As a result of our research, the total built-up area was increased in 2018 was 272 km2. Peshawar's vegetation cover has increased by 25.6% throughout the study period, especially 12.7% under the billion-tree project (from 2013 to 2018). According to CA-Markov Chain analysis, we can predict the growth of built-up area and vegetation area from 299.75 km2 (23.71%) to 318.92 km2 (25.23%) and 701.38 km2 (55.48%) to 748.69 km2 (59.23%) between 2028 and 2038, based on the development from 1998 to 2018. This study is very significant for the urban designing, urban development, policy makers and law enforcement departments.

AB  - Cities and urban regions have become central to ensuring a sustainable future. Many regions employ strategic spatial planning, a transformative and integrative public-sector-led activity, to create a coherent spatial development strategy in order to pursue sustainable development. Due to its encompassing, cross-sectoral qualities, landscape science is expected to strengthen nature-related aspects of urban planning. The aim of this paper is thus to assess the role of landscape in contemporary strategic spatial planning. This study is based on content analysis of the strategic spatial plans of 18 European urban regions. Plans were assessed following a framework that focuses on how plans took advantage of landscape’s integrative power, how plans are based in knowledge on functioning of landscape systems, and how plans show the contribution of landscapes to human well-being. The findings show that landscape science contributes considerably to strategic planning. Overall, the strategic plans of European urban regions had a strong anthropocentric perspective on landscapes. Most of the plans are based on knowledge about landscape functioning and show the contribution of landscapes to human well-being. However, only few use the full potential of the integrative power of landscapes in terms of governance processes. Based on our analysis, we identified research needs and suggested recommendations for future strategic planning with the aim of strengthening nature-related aspects in strategic spatial planning.

AB  - Classical geomorphological maps are representations of the spatial distribution of landforms, materials and of the processes responsible for their formation, in a single paper map. They contain a wealth of information that is generally documented with the aid of symbol and color legends. Uniformity among geomorphological legends does not exist, mainly because the traditional mapping ‘schools’ independently developed systems for use at different scales in a variety of landscapes. Technological advances have changed the preparation, data collection, analysis, storage, and visualization of the modern geomorphological map. Modern geomorphological maps are digital collections of information layers consisting of georeferenced vector, raster and tabular data that are stored in a geodatabase. The data depicted in classical geomorphological maps can be scanned and converted into digital geomorphological information layers using conversion legends. Both the content and the precision of digital geomorphological information can be updated by using information from digital elevation models (DEMs). A further development is the (semi-)automated extraction and classification of geomorphological features from DEMs. Extraction and classification of geomorphological features are based on land-surface parameters derived from DEMs. The visualization and publication of digital geomorphological information layers have drastically changed. Birds-eye views, three-dimensional display and animations, virtual globe visualizations, geospatial portable document format maps or access to geomorphological maps via web-based services are possible through remote servers. The end-user interactively controls the information that is on-screen displayed, analyzed, and distributed. A case study from the Austrian Alps is presented to illustrate how: (1) geomorphological information from classical maps can be converted to digital information layers; (2) detailed DEMs are used in semi-automated object-based classification of landforms; and (3) a modern geomorphological map is used for application to geoconservation.

AB  - The complexity of socioecological systems (SES) has posed a persistent challenge to the development of methods for diagnostic and prognostic analyses of global change. We developed a high dimensional statistical framework where cluster analysis was used to characterize regional landscape typologies and those typologies are linked to the outcome of interest through regression modeling. For demonstration, we applied the framework to agroecosystem of the United States Gulf Coast to evaluate the determinants of spatial variability in crop yield. Regional biophysical typologies (BPT; integrated climate, soil, and topography clusters) and socioecological typologies (SET; BPT combined with socioeconomic clusters) were developed. The SET corn model (R2 = 0.89) outperformed the BPT corn model (R2 = 0.72) and a county fixed-effect model (R2 = 0.53), which reflects the socioeconomic influence over agricultural productivity. The SET model also showed similar predictive skill for soybean and cotton yield. Therefore impact analysis for agroecosystems can lead to incorrect conclusions if biophysical factors are not examined jointly with socioeconomic factors.

AB  - Riverine wetlands provide important habitats and travel corridors for resident and transient species, playing a key role in maintaining the diversity of entire landscapes. This paper assessed a long-term (1990–2013) landscape changes and avifauna community dynamics in the Yellow River wetland natural reserves, China. Remote sensing information was combined with field surveys to collect critical data on land use and avifaunal populations. The results reveal that land use has dramatic changes during 1990–2013. Utilized water features have significantly decreased over 20 years, whereas artificial land features such as paddy, dry field and built-up area have shown a steady increasing trend in the three riverine wetlands. The spatial landscape patterns of the three wetlands have become fragmented and notably heterogeneous as results of rapid economic development. With the changes of utilized water features, avifauna data show that some overwintering and transient species are becoming permanent residents. Though there is an abundant and diverse array of bird species utilizing the wetlands, migrating traits of these avifauna species have changed. This study can provide basic information for making effective and sustainable conservation plans for the entire Yellow River wetland natural reserves.

AB  - Ecological systems are spatially heterogeneous on a wide range of scales. Landscape ecology is the science and art of studying and improving the relationship between spatial pattern and ecological processes across scales and organizational levels. In a broad sense, landscape ecology represents both a field of study and an ecological paradigm. As a highly interdisciplinary research field, landscape ecology integrates biophysical and analytical approaches with humanistic and holistic perspectives across natural and social sciences. Landscapes are spatially heterogeneous geographic areas characterized by diverse interacting patches or ecosystems, ranging from relatively natural terrestrial and aquatic systems such as forests, grasslands and lakes to human-dominated systems including agricultural and urban areas. As a paradigm, landscape ecology is characterized by its explicit emphasis on the causes, processes, and ecological consequences of spatial heterogeneity on multiple scales. Thus, the relationship between pattern, process and scale has been the focus of most landscape ecological investigations since the 1980s. Ecological flows in landscape mosaics, land use and land cover change, scaling, relating landscape pattern analysis with ecological processes, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and landscape sustainability are all among the key research topics in modern landscape ecology. During the past decades, landscape ecology perspectives have become pervasive in almost all areas of ecology, and increasingly important to biodiversity conservation, resource management, and landscape and urban planning.
