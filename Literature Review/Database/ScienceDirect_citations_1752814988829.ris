AB  - Climate change poses significant challenges to urban environments affecting both flood risks and stormwater pollutant loadings. However, studies on variations in stormwater runoff quantity and quality in cold regions, which are highly sensitive to climate change, are notably limited. Integrating climatic, hydrologic, and hydraulic modelling, the study assesses the potential impacts of climate change on stormwater runoff volume and pollutant dynamics in a Canadian urban watershed (Calgary). A two-year field program was conducted to support the calibration and validation of the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Intensity–duration–frequency curves were employed to evaluate the impacts of climate change on peak flow rate and flooding duration. In addition, typical dry, average, and wet years were applied to continuously simulate stormwater runoff quantity and quality during the 2050s and 2080s. The results suggest substantial increases in peak flow rates and flooding durations, particularly for the 5-year return period rainfall, with 1-h, 4-h, and 24-h peak inflow rates increasing by 74.3% (170.7%), 89.2% (158.4%), and 64.1% (102.8%) in the 2050s (2080s) Furthermore, the runoff quantity is projected to rise by 2.4–10.2% in the 2050s and 11.8–17.5% in the 2080s. Total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) loadings are anticipated to increase by 2.0–36.1%, 3.1–21.4%, and 4.1–20.7%, respectively. As a result, the current stormwater system could overload and stormwater quality is likely to deteriorate under the impact of climate change. The findings are beneficial for cold regions to develop adaptive strategies that enhance urban water security and environmental sustainability under climate change.

AB  - Trees in agroforestry parklands influence crops both through competitive and facilitative mechanism, but the effects are challenging to disentangle due to the complexity of the system with high variability in tree cover structure and species diversity and crop combinations. Focusing on a landscape in central Burkina Faso dominated by Vitellaria paradoxa and Parkia biglobosa, this paper examines how tree cover influences crop yield at landscape scale using satellite data and spatial statistics. Our analysis is based on data from 2017 to 2018 with differences in rainfall to assess the stability in identified relationships. Our findings showed that tree canopy cover and tree density inside the fields tended to decrease crop yield because of competition, but also that these variables when considering the surrounding landscape exerted an opposite effect because of their buffering effects. The explanatory variables representing soil properties did have limited effects on crop yield in this study. These patterns were consistent during the two years of monitoring. Overall, our results suggest that farmers in this area might manage the tree cover in a way that optimizes sustainable yields as canopy cover and tree density in most parklands is below the limits identified here where competition outweight the facilitative effects.

AB  - This chapter comprehensively explores the interplay between biochar augmentation and soil biotic processes, focusing on the structural and functional aspects of microbial communities in fertilized tropical croplands. Biochar modifies soil properties and potentially influences the composition and activities of soil microbial communities. Understanding the mechanisms underlying long-term biochar–microbe interactions is essential for sustainable agriculture and resource management. The microbial response to biochar ranges from changes in microbial abundance and diversity to shifts in microbial community structures. The intricate connections between biochar, nutrient cycling, and microbial metabolic pathways are unveiled, showcasing the potential of biochar to stimulate nutrient availability through microbial-mediated processes. The study elucidates how biochar can act as a catalyst for beneficial microbial consortia, fostering symbiotic relationships that mirror the harmonious collaborations. Biochar has shown optimal performance in maintaining functional and genetic diversity of microbes. It is capable of reducing nutrient leaching, promoting plant growth, decreasing toxicity and metal accumulation in plants, and increasing microbial and enzymatic activity in the soil. The mechanisms involved differ depending on soil types. By embracing biochar’s potential, agricultural systems can mirror the complexity and resilience of natural ecosystems, promoting sustainable productivity while preserving ecological integrity. The findings underline the significance of biochar as a transformative tool that aligns with nature’s principles to enhance soil health, foster beneficial interactions, and promote resilient ecosystems in the face of evolving agricultural challenges.

AB  - Under the compound effect of continuous global warming and rapid urbanization, China is experiencing extreme heat events with increased intensity, frequency, and duration, which pose a significant threat to human society. Nonetheless, research on the spatiotemporal patterns and regional characteristics of extreme heat disaster risk (EHDR) at the county level in China remains scarce. To address this gap, we have developed an analytical framework for extreme heat disaster systems and an evaluation system for EHDR indicators. This framework measures the extent of EHDR and examines the dominant subsystems and their transformation processes across different regions. The results show that: (1) The spatial clustering types of EHDR in China's counties are mainly "High-High" and "Low-Low", forming a significant northeast-southwest low-value belt and a northwest-southeast high-value center; (2) In China, 91.49% of counties exhibited an increasing trend in EHDR from 2000 to 2018, while the counties experiencing reduced disaster risk are predominantly located in northern China; (3) The average values of EHDR and its subsystems are significantly higher in the Northwest and the Middle and Lower reaches of the Yangtze River compared to other regions, establishing these areas as high-value clusters; (4) The transformation of dominant subsystems across regions reveals significant geographic differences. In Western China, the environment predominates; in the northern regions, environment-exposure is dominant; and in the southern regions, the hazard is the primary factor. Notably, the causes of disaster risk in the Middle reaches of the Yellow River and the Lower reaches of the Yangtze River are more complex. These findings enhance the understanding of EHDR dynamics within the framework of rapid urbanization and climate change.

Findings of this study exhibited higher daytime LST compared to nighttime with evident trend in Seoul, Incheon, and Jeju. Similarly, a great influence of SUHI showed by all cities with averaged SUHI of daytime (1.94 °C) was higher than nighttime (1.23 °C). Notably, the daytime SUHI was more pronounced in inland cities (2.3 °C) whereas, the nighttime SUHI was more evident in ocean cities (1.29 °C). Findings of this study illuminated inverse relationship of wind speed, RH, city size (r2 = 0.58, p<0.05) and city mean elevation (r2 = 0.41, p<0.05) with SUHI whereas a positive and strong correlation exhibited by population density with SUHI (r2 = 0.73/, p<0.05). Findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of SUHI patterns in South Korea, by shedding light on various environmental factors which can hold implications for urban planning and more informed decisions to combat with the adverse impacts of SUHI.

AB  - As green infrastructure (GI) proliferates as an adaptation strategy to living with increasing temperatures in urban areas, these initiatives may impact how people differentially experience the local climate and health benefits of urban greening. Scholars have studied the uneven distribution of urban greenery, but less attention has been paid to diverse plant uses and values by different sectors of the population and how those align (or not) with institutional plant preferences enshrined in GI policies. To address this gap, this article offers an in-depth case study of publicly-funded residential raingardens in a semi-arid city of the U.S. Southwest by drawing on an environmental justice framework. Through a mixed-methods approach we identify key criteria for residential plant selection among two groups from different economic and cultural backgrounds, and examine the desired benefits driving those preferences. More saliently, we found that plant preferences among low-income Hispanic residents tended to be at odds with institutional expectations of appropriate vegetation for GI installations in the context of increased heat and reduced water resources. Instead, they favored often-thirsty fruit bearing plants that provide cultural ecosystem services but are consistently excluded from the recommended plant lists used by program managers and expert practitioners. As practitioners and policy-makers seek to develop GI in historically underserved neighborhoods to reduce vulnerabilities to extreme heat, it is paramount to understand what people care to plant, what desired benefits they seek from those plants, and how they relate to plants in GI installations. Thus, this article argues that systematic attention to diversity in people-plant interactions is critical for implementing GI programs that are not only spatially, administratively, and financially accessible to underserved communities, but also culturally responsive to community identified needs. Moreover, by systematically documenting how different groups of people interact, use, and value vegetation this research adds to the movement towards integrating a biocultural approach to urban greening and to GI planning and implementation more specifically.

AB  - In the context of Chilean Metropolises such as Santiago, Valparaíso, and Concepción, ecological and social fragmentation of cities lead to significant environmental disturbances, including alterations to the urban climate, loss of biodiversity, and the gradual suppression of ecological corridors and native habitats, ultimately heightening current and future risks, and degrading the quality of life for urban residents stemming from excessive urbanisation, ineffective planning, maladaptive design, and environmental management in critical natural areas. Although an abundance of general frameworks and principles already exist, they necessitate a more contextual and integral approach that considers the natural dynamics of the landscape (landscape logic) as a base for social and economic development. This research presented a landscape approach taking the city of Valparaíso, Chile, as a case study. A methodological framework utilising mixed methods, was developed to analyse and diagnose potentialities of the landscape for developing practical knowledge for planning and design, conscious of the community demands and capacities, its ecological system and its complex geomorphology, and the future applications and assessment in biodiversity terms and social impact. A design-related research opens the opportunity as a methodology that will make it possible to incorporate different types of expertise and work on various scales. This research provides a means for developing spatial guidelines and design principles to strengthen Valparaíso’s green/blue infrastructure at multiple scales. It will ensure water security, biodiversity conservation, safer and more inclusive spaces, and better integration of informal settlements while enhancing ecosystem services for the community. Additionally, by incorporating the natural dynamics of the landscape, this approach provides ways to reduce risk, promote adaptation, and build resilience.

AB  - This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of public bus transit networks in Johor Bahru and Penang, Malaysia, using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data. It focuses on evaluating network efficiency, spatial equity, and accessibility within the myBAS Johor and Rapid Bus Penang systems. As the first academic application of Malaysia’s newly released GTFS Static datasets, this research develops an integrated methodological workflow that combines GTFS with OpenStreetMap points of interest, global walking friction surfaces, and population density rasters. The analysis employs graph-theoretic centrality metrics, kernel density estimation, the Jaccard Similarity Index, and raster-based cost surface modeling to assess transit performance across structural, spatial, and temporal dimensions. Graph-based network analysis identify key urban hubs—such as Larkin Sentral in Johor Bahru and Terminal Komtar in Penang—as critical nodes for multimodal connectivity and efficient passenger transfers. Notable spatial inequities remain, with suburban and peripheral areas facing limited transit coverage, long walking distances, and poor access to key services like healthcare, education, and commerce. Service frequency drops significantly during off-peak hours, restricting mobility for transit-dependent users. Additionally, route overlap in dense urban corridors contrasts with inadequate service in outer areas, revealing operational inefficiencies. To address these challenges, the study recommends expanding stop coverage in underserved regions, optimizing route configurations in high-demand corridors, and piloting demand-responsive transit services to enhance adaptability and inclusivity. Beyond its contributions to Malaysian transport planning, the research offers a replicable, open-data-driven approach that can inform transit modernization efforts in cities undergoing digital transitions in transit network management and accessibility planning.

AB  - Climate extremes, notably compound extremes, pose significant risks to human society and environmental systems. These extremes, heightened by urbanization—a hallmark of modern socioeconomic progression—inflict persistent, intense thermal conditions. The comprehension of urbanization's impact on compound temperature extremes, particularly in Central-South China, a region with rapid urbanization and a subtropical climate, remains limited. In addition, most existing studies relied on static urban-rural division, and few used dynamic division, with no research yet juxtaposing findings from both methods. Against this backdrop, this study provided an unprecedented assessment of urbanization's impact on both individual and compound temperature extremes in Central South China, focusing on Hunan Province during long-time period of 1960–2022 under both static and dynamic urban-rural divisions. In both urban and rural stations, a pronounced warming trend was evident across individual and compound temperature extremes. Besides, a tendency of independent day/night extremes shifting towards extremes spanning both was observed. Notably, the escalation of heat compound extreme temperature indices (ETIs) outpaces that of cold ones, with a larger urban-rural discrepancy under dynamic classifications. Urbanization intensifies temperature extremes, particularly affecting the reduction of independent cold days (30.97 %–33.94 %) and the increase in compound hot events (23.91 %–24.87 %). Interestingly, urbanization's impact is more substantial on independent daytime extremes than on independent nighttime ones. Urbanization's influence on ETIs was consistently observed under both static and dynamic classifications, with the latter revealing a more pronounced contribution (1 %–3 %), and the contribution to compound ETIs is 6 %–8 % higher than to individual ETIs. These findings emphasize the importance of considering urbanization's multifaceted impacts on climate strategies and underscore the need for adaptive infrastructure and sustainable practices to mitigate escalating climate risks.

Study focus
Compound hot-dry extreme events (CHDEs) are escalating disproportionately worldwide, posing significant challenges across various sectors. Yet, their driving mechanisms and characteristics at a regional scale remain largely uncertain. This study used a copula-based approach to construct the daily Standardized Compound Hot-Dry Index (SCHDI) to discern the intensifying trends of hot-dry extremes from 1963 to 2022, especially under different karst landscapes in Southwestern China.
New hydrological insights for the region
SCHDI variations show an escalation of hot-dry conditions across most areas, with a notable increase in extreme hot, dry, and hot-dry events. There was a consistent increase in the frequency, duration, severity, and intensity of CHDEs, with larger magnitudes observed in non-karst areas. However, karst regions exhibited a higher escalation rate in intensity, especially over the most recent three decades. Land areas affected by less severe CHDEs (e.g., abnormal: −0.31%/year) show decreasing trends over 1993–2022, while the most extreme category (e.g., extreme: 0.34%/year) has increased. The areas affected by CHDEs showed a greater increase in trend slope compared to hot or dry events alone. Additionally, these trends are further influenced by large-scale circulation patterns. Our study highlights the role of karst landscapes in escalating hot-dry extremes in Southwestern China Karst.

AB  - Sustainable Development Goals aim for a better future, but gains are threatened by conflict and governance failures, exacerbated by climate change. While research on energy security is well-established, conceptual-analytical research on sustainability transitions has paid little attention to security threats as factors influencing transitions or security policy as part of policy mixes. This paper combines policy coherence and integration analysis of energy and security strategy documents with sustainability transitions’ research, considering how landscape pressures and energy niches are presented in documents pertaining to Estonia, Finland and Scotland during 2006–2020. The findings show that security and energy policies present a functional overlap. Yet, policy integration and coherence are insufficiently addressed, conflicts created by coexisting low-carbon and hydrocarbon-based security considerations. An increasingly multifaceted landscape creates a complicated policy environment where pursuing policy coherence becomes harder. Despite the accelerating energy transition, the security implications of energy niches have received too little attention.

AB  - As a critical interface between terrestrial and marine area, the sustainable utilization of coastal resources holds paramount importance for human society's survival and economic development. The pristine condition of the coastal ecological environment serves as the fundamental basis for ensuring their sustainable exploitation. However, in recent years, intensified human activities such as engineering construction and pollutant discharge have led to a series of issues including eutrophication, gradually compromising the health of coastal zones. Therefore, it is imperative to assess and manage the eco-environment of the coastal zone amid multiple anthropogenic pressures in order to strike a balance between development and conservation, thereby achieving sustainable development of the coastal zone. Starting from the various anthropogenic pressures exerted on coastal zones, this chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the primary anthropogenic pressures affecting the ecological environment of these areas. These include environmental pollution, engineering construction, land reclamation, and overfishing. The paper summarizes key management concepts for addressing multiple anthropogenic pressures in coastal zone ecological environment management, such as integrated coastal zone management, land-sea coordination, collaborative governance, system theory and complex systems, nature-based solutions and adaptive management. Additionally, it introduces evaluation and management methods for the coastal zone ecological environment including driving-pressure-state-impact-response framework analysis, the Gray Relational Analysis and the Coupling Coordination Degree Furthermore, it presents a prediction method for assessing changes in the coastal zone eco-environment using time series analysis and machine learning models. Finally, this study concludes by summarizing future research directions for managing the coastal zone ecological environment under multiple anthropogenic pressures. The present study comprehensively synthesizes the management concepts, evaluation techniques, and forecasting methods pertaining to coastal zone management in response to multiple anthropogenic pressures, thereby offering valuable insights for the procedural aspects of coastal zone management.

AB  - Understanding the diurnal dynamics of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect in various local climate zones (LCZs) is essential for urban climate studies and planning. However, due to the limitations in spatial and temporal resolution of satellite data, current research on the continuous diurnal dynamics of LCZs at the scale of urban agglomerations remains relatively limited. This study leverages FengYun-4A (FY-4A) land surface temperature (LST) data to analyze the seasonal and diurnal characteristics of SUHI across different LCZs in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. We resampled the LCZ data and applied bilinear interpolation techniques to match the FY-4A LST data with the resampled LCZ data. We used LCZ D and LCZ A as reference to calculate the SUHI intensity (SUHII), providing a comparative baseline for assessing the SUHI effect across different urban morphologies. Additionally, we compared the LST and SUHII during heatwave periods with those during normal periods. The results indicated that all LCZ types exhibited a typical diurnal variation of SUHI, with SUHII peaking around noon and remaining stable after sunset. The LST generally increased during heat waves, with the SUHII being more pronounced in LCZ types that feature open, flat three-dimensional structures and a higher proportion of impervious surfaces. Our study demonstrates the utility of FY-4A LST data for continuous monitoring and analysis of SUHI effects within urban agglomerations, offering valuable information for urban planning and climate resilience efforts in densely populated urban agglomerations.

AB  - As cities worldwide grapple with the escalating challenges of extreme heat events, afforestation can serve as an effective adaptation measure to mitigate heat stress. This study presents a comprehensive nationwide assessment of urban tree-induced cooling effects and provides a more accurate and robust methodology that accounts for the influence of spatial heterogeneity within the complex urban environment. Results reveal that the conventional method for assessing cooling efficiency (TCE) is substantially influenced by urban heterogeneity, in terms of both horizontal and vertical structures. The revised tree cooling efficiency (RTCE), designed to minimize the impacts of other land cover types on surface temperature variations, was proved to be a more accurate estimation. In 362 out of 379 cities across China, TCE tended to underestimate the cooling effects as a result of spatial heterogeneity. The nationwide average disparity between RTCE and TCE was approximately 0.047±0.0145 ℃ per percent (95 % confidence interval). The largest differences were observed among high-rise environments, highlighting the undervalued heat mitigation potential of urban trees in compact and densely populated urban settings. This study emphasizes the considerable potential of urban tree-cooling effects in mitigating heat stress in the face of a warming planet.

AB  - Pakistan is a signatory of the Paris Agreement and is ranked among the top 10 most highly vulnerable countries towards climate change. Being the 5th most populous country in the world, with ambitious economic growth goals, a countrywide emissions assessment of the GHGs following various economic scenarios and planning objectives is crucial; especially using dynamically integrated, technologically rich, bottom-up, and robust models. Hence, we used LEAP (low emissions analysis platform) for setting up long-term decarbonization and energy transitioning pathways following global commitments (e.g. Paris Agreement) thereby contributing towards climate change mitigation and adapting net-zero policies in the country. These pathways are based on various scenarios and sub-scenarios e.g. Business as Usual (BAU), the National Decarbonization (NDS), and Net-Zero Emissions Scenario (NZES) spanning over a time-window of 2020–2050. Extensive technological reforms and changes in energy fuel mixes across residential, transportation, agriculture, industrial, and power production sectors have been anticipated. The result shows that, following NDS-based policies, 26 % GHG emissions reduction i.e. 170 MtCO2eq is possible in the short-run (2030) followed by 67 % (773 MtCO2eq) reduction in the mid-term (2040) and a remarkable 90 % (1756 MtCO2eq) reduction in the long run (2050). On the other hand, fuel-switching and substitution, an adaption of maximum renewable energy resources and hydrogen fuel in the national fuel mix followed by the proposed installations of carbon-capture and storage technologies have led to the achievement of net-zero-emissions in the NZES scenario. However, considering Pakistan's technological capabilities and economic conditions, developing a low-carbon society by achieving net-zero emissions until 2050 seems a highly ambitious plan. Nevertheless, international financial and technological support can play a vital role in helping countries like Pakistan enhance their capacity to achieve long-term decarbonization and climate resilience goals. This support can bolster Pakistan's efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy and adapt to the challenges posed by climate change.

AB  - Drought, a widely recognised and far-reaching natural hazard, has a profound impact on the global economy and the environment. This complex phenomenon, characterised by its severity, duration and spatial extent, is central to understanding its multifaceted impacts. Drought indices are an important tool for characterising and monitoring drought conditions. They provide a simplified way to understand the myriad climate factors that play a role. They also provide quantifiable measures for assessing the severity, duration and frequency of climate anomalies. In the Baltic Region, the relationships between meteorological (using the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI)) and hydrological drought (using the Streamflow Drought Index (SDI)) were analysed and the possibility of using the RDI instead of the SPI was investigated. For each index, accumulation periods of 6, 9 and 12 months were used, analysing data from the period 1961–2020. Our study attempts to investigate the relationships between the SPI, RDI and SDI indices using data from specific hydrometeorological stations across the Baltic Region, highlighting differences between four delineated sub-regions. For most accumulation periods in the northern sub-regions, SDI showed a better relationship to SPI than RDI. However, in the southwestern sub-region for late summer and early autumn and in the southeastern sub-region for long accumulation periods, RDI showed a better relationship with SDI. This pattern reveals the limitation of the RDI index in cold climate zones and its threshold could be defined as the northern boundary of the southern sub-regions. The study shows that the drought indices in the Baltic Region serve as valuable tools to characterise drought conditions and facilitate the assessment of the spatial and temporal characteristics and severity of drought.

AB  - The concept of self-containment in new towns has been widely discussed from social and economic perspectives. However, localized interpretations within the context of China's development, particularly regarding climate adaptability and urban heat island (UHI) mitigation, are scarce. To fill this gap, our research analyzed self-containment from the perspectives of urban spatial scale and land use function. Focusing on Shanghai’s five new towns, we empirically demonstrated how self-containment influenced the UHI effects from 2005 to 2020, employing the Geodetector method. The findings reveal that during the daytime, the intensity of UHI in new towns decreased, serving as vital connectivity nodes of UHI within the region. Conversely, during the nighttime, both the intensity and area of UHI showed an increasing trend. The research confirmed that expanding the urban scale and functional diversity are effective strategies for mitigating the UHI. Based on these findings, we offer practical suggestions for the development of new towns: Increase population size while ensuring coordination with development scale; enhance mixed-use functions in large-scale development projects like university towns and industrial parks; and be vigilant of potential functional decline in central areas and increasing thermal impact due to new town development. Overall, this study enriches our understanding of self-containment in Chinese new towns and provides valuable insights for mitigating UHI in other similar contexts.

AB  - Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are emerging as sustainable alternatives to conventional coastal defences against flooding and erosion. However, modelling applications to assess their efficacy often employ deterministic approaches based on historical storms, seldom incorporating effects of climate change. We argue that assessing coastal NbS performance for current and future scenarios is essential to ensure their long-term efficacy, adaptability, and potential synergies with climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. To this aim, we propose a modelling framework to investigate effectiveness of Nature-based coastal defences to mitigate climate change-driven, storm-induced flooding and erosion. An hydro-morphodynamic modelling chain (SWAN and XBeach) is setup to evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions — a dune revegetation and a seagrass meadow reconstruction — in reducing coastal inundation and shoreline retreat. The study investigates present and future what-if scenarios, by simulating storm conditions based on present, 4.5, and 8.5 W/m2 radiative forcing scenarios. Dissipative effects of vegetation are modelled by providing their characteristics and spatial distribution through habitat maps. Simple flooding and erosion reduction efficacy indicators are computed to support the assessment. The approach is applied to a case study along the Sicily coast (Italy). Results reveal that the vulnerability of the area to flooding is predominantly driven by sea level rise rather than by increase in significant wave height. In this regard, both considered interventions effectively reduce flooded areas across all investigated scenarios up to 66%, while the reconstruction of the seagrass meadow also significantly reduces storm-driven eroded volumes. Its efficacy however is less significant under 2100-time horizon scenarios, underscoring the need for NbS strategies that may be flexible and responsive to changing climate conditions.

This research focuses on thermal environment regulation performance of the corridor space of traditional dwellings in hot summer and cold winter region in China was investigated. Firstly, the field investigation and thermal comfort measurement were conducted to clarify the regulating performance of corridor space in the indoor thermal comfort and human adaptability to the environment. Then, the research uses the Grasshopper and Energy plus platforms to analyze and quantitatively verify the effectiveness of the corridor space in enhancing the indoor thermal comfort. Finally, based on the multi-objective optimization by NSGA-II, the Pareto set is generated to obtain the optimal solution for the corridor space to meet the thermal comfort. The results show that corridor of dwelling has a width of 2 m, a slope of 15°, and a height of 3.9 m. The traditional dwellings with corridor space could improve the thermal comfort hours increase by 5.1 %, the energy consumption reduce by 18.7 %. This research could help inhabitants achieve the adaptive design of corridor space and improve the livability of residential habitats in southern Shaanxi.

AB  - This paper explores the hydrological history of the Hunter River and Estuary (Newcastle, Australia), to identify pathways for incorporating climate-sensitive adaptation approaches into urban development and planning. The research method utilises mapping as a methodological discovery tools to visually articulate the correlation of pre-colonial hydrological landscapes, the transformation of the estuary over two centuries, the areas identified as at risk, and the opportunities for developing a climate-resilient estuary. This research aims to contribute to the redefinition of the discourse on the role of estuary planning for changing climate, focusing on four critical aspects: identify the impacts of urbanisation and industrialisation on ecosystems and its correlation with climate hazard at the estuary; visualise such transformations over time and space to identify critical spatial and climate factors threatening inhabitation; propose strategic spatial practices towards adaptation and resilience; and synthesising the options to foster reflective thinking and establish a correlation with novel policies, governance and practices. The study highlights that adopting new urbanism aligned with cultural and ecological principles can mitigate future climate impacts through re-naturalisation and urban adaptation to sea-level rise by focusing on proactive approaches to building resilient communities. This paper also acknowledges the need for site-specific adaptive design and planning strategies at multiple scales and governance levels.

AB  - For temperate forests, Michigan, USA, we asked: (1) does evidence exist for a height-dependent sapling recruitment bottleneck caused by shrub layer competition and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browsing and, if so, (2) how do these factors interact with light availability in shaping species-specific sapling recruitment niches? The combination of deer browsing effects on tree population height structure and the effects of deer and shrubs on tree seedling height and mortality indicate a shrub-deer bottleneck for sapling recruitment. The maximum height of deer browsing and shrub canopies as well as height dependent seedling mortality rates revealed a critical height threshold of approximately 2 m, above which trees escape from shrub and deer effects (i.e. sapling recruitment). Species’ sapling recruitment niches differed across a harvest gap size (i.e. light availability) gradient, over which tree seedling height growth potential and shrub competition increased with gap size, but deer browsing probability decreased. Specific to forests with high deer populations, niche differences were related to species growth and survival properties, with species generally falling into three groups: High Light, Broad, and Nowhere. High Light species incur high mortality from shade, shrub competition, and deer browsing. However, recruitment can occur in recently formed large gaps, where seedlings growing within developing shrub canopies avoid competition via rapid height growth and are partially protected from browsing deer. Broadspecies have lower mortality in shade and grow slower thanHigh Lightspecies and, compared to other groups, exhibit height growth and mortality rates that are less-sensitive to deer browsing pressure.These properties allowssapling recruitment ofBroadspecies over a wide range of gap sizes, including larger gaps, where, via advance regeneration, they can avoid competition with developing shrub layers following canopy disturbance.Nowherespecies are similar toBroadspecies, except their height growth and mortality are sensitive to deer browsing pressure. Heavy browsing pressure in smaller gaps and an inability to maintain taller advance regeneration to contend with shrub competition when large gaps form leaveNowherespecies without a sapling recruitment niche. In conclusion, we provide evidence that shrub competition, ungulate browsing, harvest gap size and their interactions constrain height-specific sapling recruitment among tree species in the temperate forests of Michigan. Similar mechanisms may operate in other forests with high ungulate populations. Given these drivers and current management regimes, increasing tree species diversity and resilience to future disturbances may hinge on changing and integrating forest and ungulate management paradigms.

AB  - As the impact of climate change on the agricultural sector has begun to manifest itself in its severity, adaptation planning has come under scrutiny for favoring the preservation of status-quo conditions over more substantial changes. The uptake of transformational adaptations, involving a significant re-structuring of the agricultural system, is however hindered by a lack of assessment tools capable of quantifying the effects of these often more complex, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes. Agent-based models can simulate decision processes and multi-level feedbacks between system components and may therefore illustrate how transformational adaptations emerge and help identify cases where their implementation is necessary and desirable. We explore this modelling potential and aim to quantify (1) how climate change, farmer behavior and water policies may influence strategic adaptation decision-making at the farm-level, (2) the extent to which implemented adaptations represent transformations, and (3) their impact on farm structure and wider socio-ecological change. We investigate these aims through a case study of crop farming systems in the drought-prone historical region of Romagna (NE Italy), integrating insight from stakeholder interviews, local reports, spatially-explicit biophysical data and behavioral theory in the construction of an agent-based model. Results show that, on average, more than half of all implemented adaptations are transformations, thereby requiring important social and financial investments from farmers. The number of implemented transformations is highest in scenarios where drought risk perception among farmers is more widespread, notably in scenarios simulating drier climates, more adaptive behaviors and policies promoting greater water use efficiency. Under higher drought risk perception, farmers are motivated to explore a broader set of adaptations, including those outside of the trajectory determined by their farming strategy. This process particularly favors the implementation of transformational increases in farm size and irrigated area, eventually stimulating farmers to adopt an expansionist strategy. Regionally, these adaptations lead to the smallest decline in agricultural extent with fewest, yet highest profit-earning farmers, largely exacerbating presently occurring trends. Under policy scenarios simulating increased irrigation availability, fewer farmers initially experience drought and therefore perceive a drought risk. Consequently, fewer farmers undertake transformational adaptations and switch from a contractive to an expansive strategy, culminating in a relatively smaller and less profitable agricultural extent despite a larger farmer population. As transformative changes to farming strategy trigger farmers to engage in new path-dependencies, aims of water policies may therefore rebound into unintended effects, emphasizing the importance of accounting for transformational perspectives.

AB  - Urban buildings and trees are not only core components of grey-green infrastructure but also key means for alleviating the urban heat island (UHI) effect via urban landscape design and management. However, due to data availability, few studies have used high-resolution remote sensing data and geographic information data to explore the combined effects of building and tree on diurnal land surface temperature (LST) in different urban functional zones (UFZs) from two- and three-dimensional perspectives. Therefore, this study employed Pearson correlation analysis and boosted regression tree (BRT) model to investigate the relationships between 2D and 3D morphology of building and tree and diurnal LST across UFZs, using Beijing in China as a case study. Results indicate that: (1) Significant differences exist in diurnal distribution of LST between various UFZs, so different objects should be focused on in the regulation of the diurnal urban thermal environment. (2) Dominant factors influencing LST and their marginal effect patterns vary and largely depend on observation times and UFZ contexts. (3) In all UFZs, the impact of 2D morphology on LST is far greater than that of 3D morphology during the day, and vice versa at night. Detailed 3D urban characteristics can effectively improve the interpretation of urban morphology for LSTs at the UFZ scale, with an average optimization level of 22 %. (4) The warming or cooling thresholds of dominant factors differ across UFZs. Furthermore, the diurnal marginal effect patterns of dominant factors in certain UFZs exhibit opposing trends. For such zones, stakeholders need to combine the threshold ranges at which the dominant factors produce cooling effects during day and night, and prudently consider the diurnal thermal comfort trade-offs based on the primary function of the specific location. These findings provide fresh insights into the impact of 3D urban features on diurnal LST and have significant implications for climate resilience planning and UHI mitigation strategies from diurnal and UFZ perspectives.

AB  - This study examines the application of the Integrated Landscape Character Assessment (ILCA) within the Strategic Choice of Measures (SCM) process in land use and transport planning through the lens of the transformative capacity framework. By applying this framework, the study identifies key elements of transformative capacity in the planning process. Notably, ILCA contributes to transformative capacity by fostering a systems perspective that strengthens the understanding of spatial interconnections, multi-functionality, and ecosystem services. This, in turn, supports planners in addressing complex sustainability challenges and enhances their ability to implement integrated and forward-looking planning strategies. Furthermore, the integration of ILCA into the SCM process contributed to transformative capacity by enabling knowledge co-production through inclusive stakeholder engagement. By involving actors from multiple governance levels, NGOs, and private sector representatives in working groups and workshops, the process fostered mutual learning, built shared understanding, and aligned diverse perspectives. This collaborative approach not only strengthened legitimacy but also supported the formulation and justification of measures aligned with sustainability goals, such as promoting cycling and walking infrastructure and implementing nature-based solutions (NBS), thereby enhancing both procedural and substantive dimensions of transformation.

In this context, appropriate methodological tools, which can provide a biased estimation of desertification, are critical for learning from past failures and local successes in orienting desertification towards sustainable land use. This paper proposes a locally adaptive multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) algorithm to extract the rocky desertification information from medium resolution images at subpixel level and applies it to the case of Danjiangkou reservoir region (DRR), China. Quantitative comparisons show that the locally adaptive MESMA has achieved more accurate and reliable estimations of rocky desertification information in DRR than the traditional MESMA. An inversed U-shaped trend is observed for desertified land with different severity levels from 1987 and 2013 in DRR. In particular, the inflection point roughly emerged in period 2000–2005. Casual mechanism-based regressions demonstrate that such dynamics of rocky desertification are closely coupled with socioeconomic, biophysical, and policy factors. More specifically, we identify a significantly positive role of land conservation policy in combating and relieving rocky desertification in DRR. Positive effects are observed particularly through afforestation, investment, and professionals input. Based on the conclusions and lessons of DRR, I finally make relevant recommendations for formulating policies and strategies that attempt to orient desertification towards sustainable land use. The proposed locally adaptive MESMA can act as an advanced remote sensing tool to guide the conservation policy.

AB  - This study investigated the variability of agricultural drought severity, as depicted by vegetation indices, and the bias in identifying drought events when considering a stationary vs nonstationary climate reference. The work leveraged gridded climate data (NCEP CFSv2, CHIRPS 1981–2022), soil properties (OpenLandMap), satellite imagery (Sentinel2/Landsat, 2000–2022), and future climate projections (NEX-GDDP, 2050) together with local knowledge of selected farms, to augment drought monitoring techniques and identify potential issues for agriculture. For the study domain, significant differences were observed when comparing drought characteristics using stationary and nonstationary drought indexes, with biases being not ubiquitous in either space or time of year. When developing sustainable drought mitigation and adaptation strategies, decision-makers should carefully address this uncertainty to avoid a possible underestimation of drought magnitude. Results showed a drought increase (∼50%) by the mid and late twenty-first century. Projection of future climate highlighted an even more significant impact (∼80%) with a wide variability of risk across the domain. As drought impact was also related to soil organic carbon (SOC), our results suggest that improving SOC content could be a sustainable strategy for enhancing soil drought resilience, especially in areas commonly characterized by low concentrations of organic carbon and nutrients. The analysis highlighted that drought impacts were also modulated by investment in irrigation infrastructure and irrigation efficiency. Researchers and land managers could apply the proposed analysis design to address historical, current and future indicators of vegetation conditions within irrigated regions. By providing spatio-temporal information on the patterns of drought impacts and their bias, this study supports identifying priority regions for targeted drought risk reduction and adaptation options, including water resources and soil management sustainability criteria, to move towards more resilient agricultural systems.

AB  - This research undertakes a comparative analysis of schoolyard transformation initiatives in Barcelona (Spain) and Brussels (Belgium), combining Social Network Analysis with semi-structured interviews to explore the stakeholder entanglements around making schoolgrounds greener, diverse, climate adaptive and socially inclusive. We examine the features of the social networks that coalesce around the cocreation of green schoolyards. One finding here is the fundamental role of public organizations not only as funders, but for rooting and embedding ambitious goals and progressive ideas around “schoolscapes”, despite institutional inertia and set-backs. This said, strengthening inter-school linkages would allow for cross-pollination between educational institutions around naturalizing schoolgrounds. The study also delves into the type of actor entanglements that enable the emergence of nature-rich schoolyards. A central insight here is that nature access, diversified play and socialization in schoolyards requires amplifying the agency of actors, including architects, and particularly those with expertise in grassroots participation, environmental education, and landscape ecology. In contrast, architecture firms that, prioritize aesthetic visions of nature or a consultative view of participation tend to impede, rather than facilitate the type of transformation that is at stake. Participation, we contend, needs to take place beyond the singularity of the mental plane, and get nourished by children’s inborn emotional intelligence. Ultimately, a shared ‘mentality of care’ for urban green commons, such as schoolyards, emerged as a key driver of successful 'schoolscapes'. Such mentality, however, did not arise mechanically, but was continually cultivated through the sustained commitment of school communities to nature-based education

AB  - As urban populations grow and cities expand, the challenge of managing urban heat and its environmental impacts becomes increasingly critical. Traditional methods for analyzing urban temperature dynamics often fall short in precisely capturing the complexity of urban landscapes. This paper introduces the 3D Landscape Clustering (3LC) framework, a new tool designed to analyze urban temperature dynamics by factoring in landscape variables. It clusters landscapes into homogeneous groups using high-resolution 3D land cover maps. The 3LC adopts a clustering mechanism to enhance flexibility and objectivity in landscape categorization, thereby enhancing the depth and accuracy of urban climate studies and moving beyond traditional classification frameworks such as the Local Climate Zone (LCZ). Case studies demonstrate its capability to provide detailed insights into the relationships between urban landscape features and temperature variations. Additionally, the paper details how the framework can excel in multi-city analyses and outlines advanced analytical techniques. Promising research opportunities and limitations are identified. This research reshapes our approach to landscape categorization, advancing our understanding of the interactions between landscape and climate dynamics, and contributing to more sustainable, climate-resilient cities.

AB  - The Himalayan region faces escalating challenges due to climate change, particularly dwindling springs leading to water scarcity. This study examines water access, economic well-being, and ecosystem resilience in Sikkim's Himalayan region in India, using the Dhara Vikas initiative (implemented in 2008) as a case study. Fieldwork conducted from 2013 to 2015 surveyed 339 households across eight villages, representing 47.56 % of the total households reliant on approximately 63 perennial springs. The survey revealed significant economic disparities in water usage, with higher consumption among affluent groups at lower altitudes. Only 24.1 % of households had year-round water access, highlighting widespread scarcity. The initiative increased spring discharge by 30–40 %, improved water access, and diversified local economies through poultry and dairy farming. Land use and land cover (LULC) analyses from 1989, 2002, and 2013 indicated positive changes in ecosystem resilience. The study also highlights the paradoxical relationship between spring revival initiatives and increased water demand, linking this to livelihood diversification. A roadmap for spring revival is recommended, integrating nature-based solutions with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and IUCN criteria to ensure effectiveness, biodiversity gains, and economic viability. Conclusions emphasize the need for rigorous data collection, collaborative partnerships, and innovative financing to bolster and expand nature-based solutions, ensuring the resilience of mountain communities amidst climate challenges. Recent extreme events, like the Teesta River flooding and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), underscore the urgency of such initiatives. Future research should build on this data to develop climate adaptation strategies.

AB  - On May 2, 2024, Porto Alegre in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, experienced a historic flood surpassing the catastrophic 1941 event. The flood's peak water level of 535 cm was 59 cm higher than in 1941, driven by extreme precipitation anomalies and land use changes in the Regional Metropolitan Area of Porto Alegre, with rainfall accumulations up to 500 mm in May 2024. Severe urban flooding impacted riverbanks and low-lying areas, causing significant property damage, displacement, and disruption of essential services. Agricultural lands and grasslands were extensively affected. Detailed maps from May 3 to May 8, 2024, showed floodwaters rising from 5.5 m to 8 m. Validation sample points ensured data accuracy, and flood model validation metrics (NSE = 0.63, R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 0.51 m) demonstrated the model's predictive accuracy. Water level fluctuations at Cais Guaíba station revealed rapid rise and recession periods typical of major floods. This study highlights the urgent need for effective flood mitigation strategies, informed by accurate modeling and risk assessment, to protect vulnerable communities and infrastructure. Enhancing resilience through improved urban planning, infrastructure investment, and environmental conservation is crucial to safeguarding Porto Alegre and the broader RMPOA region from future extreme weather events. These findings offer valuable insights for other flood-prone tropical and developing regions, where the combined effects of urban expansion and intensifying climate extremes similarly increase flood risk.

AB  - Small reservoirs are one of the most important sources of water for irrigation, domestic and livestock uses in the Upper East Region (UER) of Ghana. Despite various studies on small reservoirs in the region, information on their spatial-temporal variations is minimal. Therefore, this study performed a binary Random Forest classification on Sentinel-2 images for five consecutive dry seasons between 2015 and 2020. The small reservoirs were then categorized according to landscape positions (upstream, midstream, and downstream) using a flow accumulation process. The classification produced an average overall accuracy of 98% and a root mean square error of 0.087 ha. It also indicated that there are currently 384 small reservoirs in the UER (of surface area between 0.09 and 37 ha), with 20% of them newly constructed between the 2016-17 and 2019-20 seasons. The study revealed that upstream reservoirs have smaller sizes and are likely to dry out during the dry season while downstream reservoirs have larger sizes and retain substantial amounts of water even at the end of the dry season. The results further indicated that about 78% of small reservoirs will maintain an average of 54% of their water surface area by the end of the dry season. This indicates significant water availability which can be effectively utilized to expand dry season irrigation. Overall, we demonstrate that landscape positions have significant impact on the spatial-temporal variations of small reservoirs in the UER. The study also showed the effectiveness of remote sensing and machine learning algorithms as tools for monitoring small reservoirs.

AB  - Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) are important ecological systems that provide a range of supporting, cultural, provisioning, and regulating services. However, GDEs are increasingly vulnerable to climate variability and change, which can lead to changes in groundwater levels, vegetation structure, and ecosystem functioning. Remote sensing techniques offer a powerful tool for monitoring the effects of climate variability on GDEs, and the data can be used to map and monitor GDEs, assess their health and condition, and identify changes over time. By collecting data on vegetation health, water availability, and other environmental factors, remote sensing can help to identify GDEs at risk, track changes over time, and develop strategies to protect these valuable ecosystems. This chapter reviews the application of remote sensing techniques to monitor climate variability effects on GDEs. It discusses the different types of remote sensing data that can be used as well as the various methods that can be applied to analyze the data, including challenges and opportunities. These challenges include the need for ground-based data to calibrate and validate remote sensing data, the difficulty of distinguishing GDEs from other types of ecosystems, and the need to develop new methods for analyzing the complex relationships between GDEs, climate variability, and other environmental factors. Thus, by using remote sensing, we can better understand the impacts of climate change on these important ecosystems and develop effective management strategies to protect them. Overall, the chapter concludes that remote sensing has the potential to play a vital role in monitoring and protecting GDEs in the face of climate variability and change. By providing regular and comprehensive data on these ecosystems, remote sensing can help researchers and managers to make informed decisions about how to conserve and protect GDEs for future generations.

AB  - The rapid urbanization of Delhi has significantly transformed its Land Use and Land Cover (LULC), leading to profound alterations in Land Surface Temperature (LST) and exacerbating environmental challenges. Therefore, this study integrates multi-temporal Landsat imagery, advanced machine learning techniques, and landscape fragmentation indices to assess the impact of urban expansion on LST from 2001 to 2021. LULC classification was conducted using the Random Forest algorithm, achieving high classification accuracy. Landscape metrics such as Number of Patches (NP), Largest Patch Index (LPI), Mean Patch Area (MPA), Patch Density (PD), Landscape Shape Index (LSI), and Fractal Dimension (FD) were computed to quantify urbanization trends. The mono-window algorithm was used for LST retrieval, and a spatial regression framework incorporating Spearman’s correlation and multivariate regression models was applied to establish statistical relationships between urbanization metrics and temperature variations. Results indicate a 50 % increase in built-up area, accompanied by an 81 % reduction in open land and a 15 % decline in cropland over two decades. LST exhibited a substantial rise, with the mean temperature in built-up regions increasing from 36.58 °C in 2001 to 41.81 °C in 2021, and peak temperatures reaching 51.60 °C, highlighting the intensification of the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Regression analysis revealed a strong negative correlation between LPI and LST (R² = 0.99), indicating that fragmented urban structures contribute to higher temperatures. Conversely, LSI and FD showed positive correlations with LST, confirming that irregular and dispersed urban growth patterns exacerbate thermal stress. These findings underscore the need for sustainable urban planning, emphasizing compact city development, green infrastructure, and water body conservation to mitigate UHI effects.

AB  - Designing and implementing an effective protected area management (PAM) plan is a great challenge. This paper develops a conceptual framework with a set of principles for through assessment of the PAM plans for three protected areas in Turkey; Kızılkuyu, Tek Tek Mountains and Karacadağ Steppes and proposes improvements. The assessment showed that the plans are a comprehensive initiative and a reputable model for an integrated PAM planning paradigm, aside from few limitations. A holistic approach based on landscape characterization and vision was used to prepare the management plans simultaneously. A management strategy was formulated to define the vision, targets, policies, objectives and the sub-programs for each thematic area. Baseline condition was determined with a field survey to characterize landscape structure, historical and cultural values and biodiversity focusing on the target species such as Terebinth (Pistacia palaestina Boiss.), crop wild relatives (CWR) and Cream-coloured cursor (Cursorius cursor). Low income, property conflicts, urbanization pressure, habitat loss, land degradation, overuse, food security, climate changes and illegal excavation were identified as major threats and risks. A sound multi-organizational governance model with an appropriate monitoring program was developed and proposed with the defined roles. The lack of scenario analysis with the appropriate decision making tools and methods, lack of common working culture and tools, insufficient representation and characterization of a full spectrum of ecosystem services were identified as major drawbacks. While few, these shortcomings may create a far-sighted design and governance concern and jeopardize the sustainable management of the protected areas. Effective protection and expansion of steppe ecosystems, capacity building on the long-term strategic planning and scenario analysis with a DSS, maintaining the active involvement of stakeholders, development of buffers and stepping stones for creating protected area networks, developing policy documents, and resolving property issues are proposed as improvement strategies for an efficient PAM system.

AB  - Multiple anthropogenic challenges threaten nature's contributions to human well-being. Agricultural expansion and conventional intensification are degrading biodiversity and ecosystem functions, thereby undermining the natural foundations on which agriculture is itself built. Averting the worst effects of global environmental change and assuring ecosystem benefits, requires a transformation of agriculture. Alternative agricultural systems to conventional intensification exist, ranging from adjustments to efficiency (e.g. sustainable intensification) to a redesign (e.g. ecological intensification, climate-smart agriculture) of the farm management system. These alternatives vary in their reliance on nature or technology, the level of systemic change required to operate, and impacts on biodiversity, landscapes and agricultural production. Different socio-economic, ecological and political settings mean there is no universal solution, instead there are a suite of interoperable practices that can be adapted to different contexts to maximise efficiency, sustainability and resilience. Social, economic, technological and demographic issues will influence the form of sustainable agriculture and effects on landscapes and biodiversity. These include: (1) the socio-technical-ecological architecture of agricultural and food systems and trends such as urbanisation in affecting the mode of production, diets, lifestyles and attitudes; (2) emerging technologies, such as gene editing, synthetic biology and 3D bioprinting of meat; and (3) the scale or state of the existing farm system, especially pertinent for smallholder agriculture. Agricultural transformation will require multifunctional landscape planning with cross-sectoral and participatory management to avoid unintended consequences and ultimately depends on people's capacity to accept new ways of operating in response to the current environmental crisis.

AB  - CONTEXT
A region's agricultural practices, particularly farmers' choices regarding plowing and planting, influence the adaptability of croplands to climate change. However, the role of these agronomic landscapes in mediating cropland responses to diverse climate conditions remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE
This study evaluates a typical watershed in Northeast China. We continuously tracked shifts in crop distribution patterns and associated field yield to determine how agronomic landscapes impacted cropland productivity during both dry and wet years.
METHODS
Object-oriented methods were employed to extract field boundaries in a representative sub-watershed. We mapped agronomic landscape patterns based on the following elements: crop type, landscape position, and ridge direction. We then compared field productivity, as measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), across various agronomic landscapes and climatic years from 2016 to 2023.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Our findings indicate that cropland productivity is associated with agronomic landscapes. Maize productivity demonstrated an increasing trend from low to high landscape positions; whereas, soybean productivity peaked at medium positions and was lowest in uphill and downhill locations. Specifically, agronomic landscapes reflected by cross ridges at the toeslope exhibited the lowest productivity for both maize and soybeans. In addition, landscapes incorporating soybeans demonstrated greater adaptability to varying weather conditions compared to those dominated by maize. During wet years, landscapes with maize situated in the footslope with strike ridges exhibited higher productivity. In contrast, landscapes incorporating soybeans displayed robust productivity across most landscape positions, particularly in the toeslope with strike ridges. During dry years, landscapes featuring maize in both the footslope with strike ridges and the toeslope with cross ridges demonstrated greater productivity. Similarly, landscapes with soybeans distributed throughout the watershed, especially in the footslope with cross ridges and toeslope with strike ridges, exhibited higher yields.
SIGNIFICANCE
Our findings highlight the crucial role of optimizing agronomic landscapes to enhance the climate resilience of croplands and ensure stable yields. It is thus suggested that the implementation of crop sequences and their spatial arrangement in watersheds should be prioritized to lessen the adverse effects of climate change.

AB  - This study provides insight into the potential of experiment-based policy making to address complex environmental challenges. The investigation shows the usefulness of making an analytical distinction between incremental and synoptic policy experiments to understand successful change over time. Incremental refers here to gradual adjustment of policies in a specific context, synoptic to radical change of policies on a large scale. Success is understood in terms of drawing lessons and realising policy goals, enabling diffusion and improving environmental status. This unique study, including both the initial investigation and a follow-up 10 years after, analyses the dynamics that emerged from seven empirical cases to identify factors affecting the design and success of these two types of experiments. We studied three incremental experiments and four synoptic experiments in the Dutch fen landscape to learn from their practical experiences. This densely populated and commercially used landscape is vulnerable to environmental pressure such as precipitation peaks, sea level rise and droughts. Initiators of the incremental experiments were able to change land-use management practices, albeit staying relatively close to the status quo. In contrast, while initiators of the synoptic experiments expressed higher ambitions in terms of change, these experiments tended to experience stagnation and difficulties in implementation and diffusion. Observations reveal that experiment-based policy change may crucially depend on capacity to deal with stakeholder dynamics and to embed experiments within multi-level institutional settings.

AB  - Countering the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation on ecosystems requires complementing conservation areas with Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures within landscapes to promote biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services (ES). However, critical knowledge gaps persist in where and how natural elements should be restored to improve landscape connectivity to simultaneously support, and reduce trade-offs between biodiversity and ES. In virtual landscape experiments that allow exploring the effects of spatial patterns systematically, we generated alternative landscape restoration scenarios aimed at fostering ecological connectivity. Scenarios varied in the location and size of restored areas complementing existing natural areas. We analysed the impact of these scenarios on four bundles representing distinct priorities of target ES and biodiversity-related values. As expected, all bundles were favoured by increasing restored area in the landscape, but they were promoted by different spatial configurations. Restoration scenarios that fostered high aggregation of natural habitats promoted biodiversity and cultural value-related bundles, while smaller natural elements dispersed throughout the landscape were more beneficial for the sustainable production and climate adaptation bundles. These contrasts were most pronounced at low restoration targets, where landscape configuration had greatest impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Effective spatial planning of restoration initiatives within landscapes should consider these trade-offs, along with context-specific constraints, when prioritizing areas for restoration or conservation. Our findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how protected and restored areas can be integrated within landscapes to jointly support connectivity for both biodiversity and people.

AB  - The species Pinus radiata is highly invasive in native forests in Chile, drastically affecting the functioning and structure of ecosystems. Hence, it is imperative to develop robust approaches to detect P. radiata invasions at different scales. Models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have proven to be a promising alternative to detect plant invasions in high-resolution remote sensing data, such as those obtained by drones. However, studies have been limited in their spatial variability and their assessments of transferability or transfer learning to new sectors, hindering the ability to use these models in a real-world setting. We train models based on CNN architectures using unpiloted aerial vehicle data and evaluate their ability to transfer learning outside the training domain using regression approaches. We compared models trained with low spatial variability (mono-site) with those with high spatial variability (multi-site). We further sought to maximize the transference of learning outside the training domain by searching among different architectures and models, maximizing the evaluation in an independent data set. The results showed that transfer learning is better when multi-site models with higher spatial variability are used for training, obtaining a coefficient of determination R2 between 60% and 87%. On the contrary, mono-site models present a wide variability of performance attributed to the dissimilarity of information between sites, limiting the possibilities of using these models for extrapolations or model generalizations. We also obtained a significant difference between within-domain generalization using test data versus transfer learning outside the training domain, showing that testing data alone cannot depict such discrepancy without further data. Finally, the best models for transfer learning on new data domains often do not agree with those selected by the standard training/validation/testing scheme. Our findings pave the way for deeper discussions and further investigations into the limitations of CNN models when applied to high-resolution imagery.

AB  - Global urbanization has exacerbated the heat island effect and carbon emissions, and urban and rural blue-green landscapes are critical for mitigating climate change. Traditional research has overlooked the non-linear mechanisms of the trade-off between carbon sinks and heat island effects, as well as heterogeneous landscape assemblages. Using the Harbin-Changchun Urban Agglomeration in China as an illustration, this investigation integrates a self-organized mapping model and an interpretable machine learning method to establish a characterization framework for blue-green landscape assemblages. The objective is to quantify the response mechanisms and nonlinear thresholds of net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation, land surface temperature (LST), and their trade-offs. The findings demonstrated that (1) a total of seven types of blue-green landscape combination patterns were identified, with woodland-aggregated landscapes being the dominant type, which could achieve high NPP with low LST. (2) The thresholds of forested land percentage (FP), vegetation cover (FVC), and elevation coefficient of variation (ECV) were the primary factors influencing NPP, while FVC was more influential in regulating the marginal effect of LST. (3) Enhancing carbon sinks and regulating surface temperature can be achieved by maintaining FP within the range of 0.5–0.75. The lowest trade-off between NPP and LST can be achieved by setting FVC to 0.6. (4) It is imperative to prevent the functional attenuation that is caused by inefficient combinations of indicators and extreme threshold intervals, as NPP, LST, and their trade-offs are subject to the comprehensive influence of the interaction of multiple indicators. This study identified fine control thresholds for blue-green landscapes that are based on the characteristics of the landscape assemblage. These thresholds can serve as a spatial decision-making foundation for the mitigation of urban heat islands and the attainment of carbon neutrality standards.

AB  - We unified the recent literature with the goal to contribute to the discussion on how genetic diversity might best be conserved. We argue that this decision will be guided by how genomic variation is distributed among manageable populations (i.e., its spatial structure), the degree to which adaptive potential is best predicted by variation across the entire genome or the subset of that variation that is identified as putatively adaptive (i.e., its genomic structure), and whether we are managing species as single entities or as collections of diversifying lineages. The distribution of genetic variation and our ultimate goal will have practical implications for on-the-ground management. If adaptive variation is largely polygenic or responsive to change, its spatial structure might be broadly governed by the forces determining genome-wide variation (linked selection, drift, and gene flow), making measurement and prioritization straightforward. If we are managing species as single entities, then population-level prioritization schemes are possible so as to maximize future pooled genetic variation. We outline one such scheme based on the popular Shapley value from cooperative game theory that considers the relative genetic contribution of a population to an unknown future collection of populations.

AB  - This paper quantifies the impacts of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center (JJCC) green roof and the nearby redevelopment of Hudson Yards (Midtown West, Manhattan, New York City, NY) on the local microclimate. The analysis was performed using ENVI-met, a grid based, three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics model commonly used to simulate surface-plant-air interactions in urban settings. Using air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed and direction measured onsite on July 22, 2014, a total of six simulations were run, comprising three different stages of redevelopment (e.g., in 2014, 2018, and 2021), with and without the JJCC green roof in place. Under the simulated climate conditions, the green roof reduced air temperature over the no-green roof (NoGR) condition, primarily on the north side of the JJCC. However, because of the nearby redevelopment, the cooling benefit provided by the roof decreased slightly over time. For example, at 1:00 p.m. the air temperature dropped from 0.75 K at roof level in 2014, to 0.65 K and 0.64 K in 2018 and 2021, respectively. Similarly, though to a lesser extent, the same trends were evident in the simulations at pedestrian level. The redevelopment of Hudson Yards reduced the sky view factor (SVF) and provided shading during the day, reducing daytime mean radiant temperature (MRT). However, the same buildings raised nighttime MRT. Together, the study provides insights into the growing understanding of how green roofs can impact the microclimate of complex urban environments.

The first step in the methodology for proposing and analyzing intervention alternatives to reduce risk was the flood probabilistic risk assessment, where uncertainties associated with the flood occurrence and the potential damage to exposed elements were included in the risk assessment. To evaluate a variety of combinations of different structural intervention alternatives and to better assess the merit of each combination, a cost–benefit analysis was carried out, through which, according to defined criteria, it was possible to determine the optimal combination of the engineering interventions, some of them related to nature-based solutions, where the comprehensiveness of actions within the framework of eco-safety, well-being, territorial ordering, and the pursuit of sustainability has been necessary.

AB  - Carbon storage plays a pivotal role in addressing climate change, maintaining ecological equilibrium, and fostering sustainable development. Gansu Province, situated in the arid to semi-arid region of Northwestern China, is confronted with substantial carbon storage losses as a result of ongoing ecological land desertification processes. However, studies on carbon storage loss under various scenarios in desertified regions are seldom reported. In this study, we delineated the ecological red line using quantified indicators encompassing multiple ecosystem service functions and ecological vulnerability sensitivity. Furthermore, we projected future land use and carbon storage transformations under multiple policy scenarios employing the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model. Lastly, we unveiled spatial disparities in the driving factors behind alterations in carbon storage by geographically weighted regression model. Our findings suggest that: (1) The delineated ecological red line covers an area of 11.8 × 104 km2, approximately 27 % of the total land area of Gansu Province. (2) Quantitative findings reveal that the overall accuracy of the PLUS model reached an impressive 0.975, accompanied by a Kappa coefficient of 0.964, thus affirming the model's exceptional applicability. (3) Under the base line scenario, Gansu Province's carbon storage witnesses a consistent decline from 2000 to 2050, with a substantial total loss of 1.62 × 107 t over the ensuing three decades. The ecological red line scenario, by controlling 27 % of the land area in Gansu Province, achieves a 61.7 % effect of the global ecological scenario by 2050, thus reversing the declining trend in carbon storage. (4) Natural factors primarily influence carbon storage in the southeastern region, while human activity factors are distributed in the central region. This study offers scientifically robust policy recommendations to facilitate the attainment of carbon neutrality objective.

AB  - Landscape patterns in a region have different sizes, shapes and spatial arrangements, which contribute to the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape and are linked to the distinct behavior of thermal environments. There is a lack of research generating landscape metrics from discretized percent impervious surface area data (ISA), which can be used as an indicator of urban spatial structure and level of development, and quantitatively characterizing the spatial patterns of landscapes and land surface temperatures (LST). In this study, linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) is used to derive sub-pixel ISA. Continuous fractional cover thresholds are used to discretize percent ISA into different categories related to urban land cover patterns. Landscape metrics are calculated based on different ISA categories and used to quantify urban landscape patterns and LST configurations. The characteristics of LST and percent ISA are quantified by landscape metrics such as indices of patch density, aggregation, connectedness, shape and shape complexity. The urban thermal intensity is also analyzed based on percent ISA. The results indicate that landscape metrics are sensitive to the variation of pixel values of fractional ISA, and the integration of LST, LSMA. Landscape metrics provide a quantitative method for describing the spatial distribution and seasonal variation in urban thermal patterns in response to associated urban land cover patterns.

AB  - The blue landscape (BL), which refers to the wetlands, rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water, is of immense importance for a sustainable environment. It provides a variety of ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, water purification, soil fertility, and habitat for diverse flora and fauna. These services are crucial for sustaining the livelihoods of local communities and maintaining the health of the environment. In megacities like Kolkata, India, the BL is often subjected to fragmentation and degradation due to rapid urbanisation, industrialization, and other human activities. This has serious implications for ecosystem services and the overall health of the environment. This study is intended to value ecosystem service losses over the last 25 years and assess the influence of blue landscape fragmentation on ecosystem services in Kolkata, India. To accomplish this goal, satellite data was collected from 1994 to 2019 for both pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The results of the study showed that significant losses in ecosystem services were observed over this time period, primarily due to the decline of the East Kolkata Wetland and its conversion for settlement and agricultural purposes. Despite the existence of some policies aimed at protecting the wetland, more robust restrictions and remedial strategies are required to conserve and restore the blue landscape in Kolkata. This work adds to the corpus of research on the value of blue landscapes (BLs) and the environmental services they provide. The findings of this study highlight the need for increased attention to the conservation and management of BLs in India and provide a valuable foundation for future research and policy development. Furthermore, this research introduces the innovative concept of urban BLs as a nature-based framework for understanding urban landscape fragmentation, a novel contribution that fills a gap in the existing literature on this topic.

AB  - Agricultural landscapes are the result of the long-term, complex, and intermingled interfaces between nature and culture. Among the stakeholders involved in the production of agri-environmental and climate services, farmers play a crucial role, and their contribution should be duly acknowledged to promote sustainable land management. Therefore, this research aims to contribute to the participatory design of agri-environmental contracts to incentivize landscape and biodiversity practices. To achieve this goal, 13 innovation labs with multi-actor perspective were established across nine different European countries. These groups envisioned a future sustainable landscape characterized by diversity and balance of economic, socio-cultural, and environmental components. Trust-based networks and effective communication channels emerge as vital components for the success of sustainable local production systems. Practitioners emphasize the significance of European-level policies in effecting transformative change and influencing farmers'willingness to contribute to both food production and environmental public goods. They defined concrete contract features such as public funding, hybrid payments, and the presence of intermediaries for the potential of agri-environmental measures. Notably, practitioners perceive a wide range of benefits associated with the implementation of agri-environmental measures, extending beyond economic compensation. Gaining a deeper understanding of practitioners' perceptions of their territories and agri-environmental measures is crucial for policymakers to design tailored and appealing programs that resonate with practitioners'needs.

AB  - Alpinism, a high-risk and skill-intensive form of mountain tourism, is deeply intertwined with the mountain environment, making it a practice highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change. This study examines European alpinists' motivations and the impact of climate-driven landscape changes, like glacier retreat and increased hazards. Using a mixed-methods approach, the study combines a survey of 1071 alpinists with 30 in-depth interviews to identify key motivational constructs and how a changing climate influences these constructs. Results reveal that motives centre on the natural environment, social connection, the sporting nature of alpinism, and achieving iconic climbing objectives. The analysis highlights the emergence of a “last-chance to climb” motive, driven by disappearing or increasingly inaccessible routes due to climate change.

AB  - Wild foods and other nonfood NTFPs are important for improving food security and supplementing incomes in rural peoples' livelihoods. However, studies on the importance of NTFPs to rural communities are often limited to a few select sites and are conducted in areas that are already known to have high rates of NTFP use. To address this, we examined the role of geographic and household level variables in determining whether a household would report collecting wild foods and other nonfood NTFP across 25 agro-ecological landscapes in Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Ghana. The aim of this study was to contribute to the literature on NTFP collection in Africa and to better understand where people depend on these resources by drawing on a broad range of sites that were highly variable in geographic characteristics as well as rates of NTFP collection to provide a better understanding of the determinants of NTFP collection. We found that geographic factors, such as the presence of forests, non-forest natural areas like grasslands and shrublands, and lower population density significantly predict whether a household will report collecting NTFP, and that these factors have greater explanatory power than household characteristics

AB  - Savannas, complex ecosystems characterized by an intricate blend of grasslands and woodlands, span vast portions of the global terrestrial landscape. These ecosystems not only serve as biodiversity hotspots but also support vast human populations and play a significant role in the Earth's carbon cycle. In this chapter, we embarked on an in-depth exploration of the distinctiveness of savannas, emphasizing their spatial heterogeneity, ranging from open grasslands to dense woodlands, and the complex temporal fluctuations dictated by seasonal shifts, fire regimes, and longer-term changes instigated by broader climatic shifts. Remote sensing emerges as a promising tool for studying these landscapes, given its ability to offer large-scale, repetitive, and detailed observations. However, it is not without challenges. We dissected the difficulties of interpreting mixed pixels, navigating rapid seasonal transitions in vegetation that sometimes surpass satellite revisit intervals, detecting and differentiating burn scars post-fire, and contending with atmospheric interferences like frequent cloud cover, particularly pronounced in tropical savannas. This chapter also underscores the innovations in technology and methodology that provide avenues to circumvent these challenges. Multi-sensor approaches amalgamate data from various sensors to refine vegetation characterization. Advanced machine learning and AI-driven algorithms are emerging as pivotal approaches, aiding in sophisticated image processing, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. But even in this age of GeoAI, the importance of ground-truthing remains paramount. In-situ observations and measurements fortify the credibility of remote sensing data, anchoring them in tangible, on-the-ground realities. While the present offers a gamut of tools and methodologies to study savannas, the future is even more promising. It beckons with the possibility of seamlessly integrated multi-sensor systems, more advanced AI models tailored for savanna studies, and a deeper symbiosis between technology and traditional field surveys. As we stand on this cusp, it is imperative to remember that understanding and preserving savannas is not just an academic pursuit; it is a commitment to our planet's ecological richness and resilience.

AB  - This paper examines the procedures through which climate change can be rendered governable in the present. Climate change has generally been approached as an abstract, global, and long-term problem, thereby disconnecting it from the places and times in which decisions are made. Relational thinking in geography has articulated the local and regional levels of climate governance, hence foregrounding the practices through which the climate is situated in concrete local and organisational contexts. However, in time climate change has remained an abstract and long-term problem. This calls for studies of how the need for rapid climate action can be established in the present, and how climate governance can be aligned with the temporal rhythms in which organisations operate. This paper examines Oslo’s “climate budgets”, an innovative governance tool which integrates climate planning into the regular municipal budgeting cycle. It brings attention to the practices through which different temporalities of climate action are aligned, how climate change is rendered legible, and how uncertainties are managed. Drawing on the literatures on temporality and governmentality, it develops a conceptual approach to assess the practices through which responsibility for global, long-term concerns can be articulated in the present.

AB  - Coastal regions of Bangladesh face increasingly complex environmental risks from tropical cyclones, yet comprehensive vulnerability assessments remain limited. This study introduces an innovative approach to coastal vulnerability assessment for the western coastal zone of Bangladesh by integrating advanced geospatial techniques with a surge-wave-hydrodynamic model using Delft3D. By analyzing multiple critical parameters including coastal slope, elevation, sea level rise, tide range, cyclone track proximity, coastline characteristics, and land use/land cover, the study develops a Coastal Vulnerability Index considering the impact of super cyclone Amphan. The methodology synthesizes physical indices through evaluation of spatially distributed vulnerability parameters, reveals that almost 5 % of the studied coastal area can be classified as very highly vulnerable and 85 % area as highly vulnerable. Specific findings highlight extreme risks in districts like Bhola, where around 95 % of the area demonstrates potential of high coastal hazard. This analysis exposes critical limitations of traditional coastal defense mechanisms, as evidenced by 93 complete embankment failures during cyclone Amphan and extensive flooding across multiple districts. By providing a comprehensive data-driven environmental risk assessment, the study offers crucial insights for policymakers, planners, and disaster management professionals, presenting a strategic framework for developing targeted adaptation and mitigation strategies in increasingly dynamic coastal environments.

AB  - Understanding multifaceted climate change risks and their interconnections is essential for effective adaptation strategies, which require comprehensive assessments of both climatic impact variations and social–environmental exposures/vulnerabilities. This study examines these interconnections and creates multitier delineations of future climate risks across Japan by overlaying homogeneous impact zones (HIZs) with exposure–vulnerability complexes (EVCs). We delineated eight EVC regions, each exhibiting similar patterns of exposure and vulnerability, via multivariate clustering and similarity search on the basis of future population and land cover/use data. Under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5 scenario, 8.07 % of Japan's area was identified as urban, 66.18 % as forest, and 16.66 % as agricultural land, depending on vulnerability and exposure characteristics. We then spatially intersected these EVCs with six HIZs, which represent common patterns of multisectoral climatic impact variations. This intersection revealed low geographical correspondence between climatic impact variations and exposure–vulnerability factors, indicating high spatial variability in climate risk across Japan. The use of EVCs helps identify areas with anticipated climate change risks. The spatial nexus between HIZs and EVCs underscores the geographical complexity and diversity of climate risks, revealing regions with high-impact variations alongside significant exposures and vulnerabilities. For example, urban EVCs highlight critical issues such as heat-related mortality and flood damage. By mapping these impact variations while focusing on exposure and vulnerability disparities, insights from HIZs and EVCs can inform future climate risk management and effective adaptation strategies at the national and regional levels.

AB  - Effective climate change adaptation planning requires evaluating the interplay of physical landscape characteristics and community perceptions of places. Geographic information system (GIS)-based approaches to measuring environmental values can identify locations for planning prioritization. But they seldom are used to consider spatial differences in socio-ecological worldview. This study aims to identify how place-based risk perceptions and landscape values can inform climate change adaptation using a Q+PPGIS method. We integrated mapped landscape values and climate risks (from 39 PPGIS participants) with elicited discourses (for 28 Q-method participants) to develop a novel land classification approach (reflexive Q+PPGIS). The results demonstrate significant differences between wilderness as a discourse and perceived, and the physical features associated with mapped wild areas. Similar differences in discourse and spatial patterns are observed for climate risks. For example, participants’ mapped areas of bushfire risk do not align with agencies’ identified risk areas, their jurisdictions, and capacities to take action. This disconnect presents a challenge to adaptation. Local governments can use this new method to show constituents multiple and often competing community demands for action, enabling honest conversations about feasible actions, responsibilities, and resource allocation.

AB  - Oases in arid regions critically regulate surface and air temperatures by altering surface energy partitioning, yet the biophysical mechanisms controlling their thermal regulation efficiency and the trade-off between cooling benefits and water consumption remain poorly quantified. To bridge this knowledge gap, we developed the Oasis Cooling Efficiency (OCE) index − a biophysical metric synergistically combining satellite-derived land surface temperature with Priestley-Taylor (PT) model-based evapotranspiration (ET) estimates. Using partial derivative analysis, we quantified the sensitivity of OCE and Oasis Cooling Intensity (OCI) to key environmental drivers. Our results demonstrated that: 1) OCI exhibited strong diurnal asymmetry, with daytime cooling averaging 5.01 K but diminishing nocturnally (−0.82 K). OCI was driven by ET contrasts (ΔET, r = 0.79) and albedo differences (ΔAbd, r = 0.38), with ΔET contributing dominantly (elasticity = 0.48). Specifically, VPD dominated OCI variation (−39.86%), while soil moisture (SM) and NDVI enhanced it (+17.68%, +19.68%). 2) OCE demonstrated significant heterogeneity (0.06–0.32 K/mm), peaking in forests (1.25 K/mm) and showing hyperbolic decay with ΔET. VPD dominated OCE declines (−16%), while SM enhanced it (+1.4%). 3) OCI increased with the intensification of both atmospheric and soil droughts, with atmospheric drought exerting a stronger influence. OCE decreased under atmospheric drought but increased under soil drought. Compound droughts amplified OCI (+65%) while collapsing OCE (−62%), exposing unsustainable water costs. These findings establish a framework for optimizing oasis cooling benefits while balancing water conservation in arid regions.

AB  - Cities and urban regions have become central to ensuring a sustainable future. Many regions employ strategic spatial planning, a transformative and integrative public-sector-led activity, to create a coherent spatial development strategy in order to pursue sustainable development. Due to its encompassing, cross-sectoral qualities, landscape science is expected to strengthen nature-related aspects of urban planning. The aim of this paper is thus to assess the role of landscape in contemporary strategic spatial planning. This study is based on content analysis of the strategic spatial plans of 18 European urban regions. Plans were assessed following a framework that focuses on how plans took advantage of landscape’s integrative power, how plans are based in knowledge on functioning of landscape systems, and how plans show the contribution of landscapes to human well-being. The findings show that landscape science contributes considerably to strategic planning. Overall, the strategic plans of European urban regions had a strong anthropocentric perspective on landscapes. Most of the plans are based on knowledge about landscape functioning and show the contribution of landscapes to human well-being. However, only few use the full potential of the integrative power of landscapes in terms of governance processes. Based on our analysis, we identified research needs and suggested recommendations for future strategic planning with the aim of strengthening nature-related aspects in strategic spatial planning.

AB  - A consideration of the site-specific spatial experience created by urban trees and their cultural dimensions can enrich climate adaptive tree planting strategies in Winnipeg, a city of 850,000 in the central prairies of Canada. The paper begins with an introduction to traditional urban tree planting types and analyses the range of tree planting techniques that currently define public spaces in Winnipeg. A review of the recently published Urban Forest Strategy for Winnipeg highlights current strengths and challenges to climate change related tree planting in the city. Urban tree planting strategies and practices demonstrate a focus on quantifiable goals such as canopy coverage, number of trees planted or ecosystem services, with little reference to how trees define places. However, cities are constituted by the visible forest-the form and patterns of how trees are planted and the spaces they create. They are also shaped by the invisible forest, the diverse ways in which trees evoke different functions, values, and modes of occupation to different people at different times. Two basic approaches to urban tree planting will enrich climate-related tree planting initiatives by synthesizing the visible and invisible dimensions of the urban forest: Prioritizing the collective planting of trees as opposed to the single specimen and acknowledging the cultural dimensions of trees. Two design propositions from students at University of Manitoba demonstrate how trees can articulate the diverse ways people interact with trees through their spatial configuration and planting techniques. One draws upon tree types that acknowledge local agricultural tree planting strategies and the second responds to historical and contemporary Indigenous relationships to riparian trees. Acknowledging the planting of trees as a complex interplay between spatial, ecological, and cultural specificity allows for the communication of new values for the design and stewardship of urban trees and the provision of shade in a climate adaptive city.

AB  - Game-based approaches using role-play can foster engagement in climate policy discussions and promote climate action as they emphasise dialogue and discussion. This study investigates the impact of a role-play intervention on climate change engagement, focusing on the mediating role of discussion quality. A total of 191 students aged 15+ from 10 school classes across rural, urban, and provincial areas in Austria participated in a 1.5-hour intervention. Participants adopted the roles of policymakers tasked with promoting green jobs for youth, engaging in discussions and developing policy strategies on three key sub-issues. The intervention was facilitated through an interactive survey platform that incorporated multimedia content to support dialogue and decision-making. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires assessed climate engagement outcomes, including collective efficacy beliefs, collective action intentions, and climate change beliefs, as well as perceived discussion quality. Structural Equation Modelling revealed only limited intervention effects, though higher perceived discussion was positively associated with beliefs in the reality of climate change after the intervention. Exploratory analysis revealed considerable variation of intervention effects across school classes. This research demonstrates the potential and limitations of structured discussions facilitated through role-play to engage students in climate issues and provides guidance for refining future intervention designs.

AB  - The paper presents a multi-criteria method for unitary projects related to open spaces along urban road networks, with a focus on green spaces at roundabout intersections, considering them as integral part of broader landscape systems, and therefore as an opportunity for the construction of green infrastructures. The sprawl of road networks and the evolution of their types have gradually created a remarkable repertoire of new categories of open spaces, which, despite their often small size and residual nature, collectively can no longer be neglected. Innovative urban planning can transform these residual spaces into a distinctive feature of the city. Within this framework, we present a case-study on green spaces inside and adjacent to urban roundabouts in the City of Imola (Bologna), in the Emilia Romagna Region (Italy). They have been conceived as gardens, in order to enhance cultural values and foster a responsible use of environmental resources. The novelty of work lies in the holistic and cross-scale approach. Our proposal is based on a combination of multiple design issues (scenic values, landscape ecology, socio-economic sustainability) and specific characters of the context, with the aim of fulfilling aesthetic and functional requirements at the landscape level. The study defines spatial composition criteria, vegetation abacus and maintenance plans, articulated according to the various systems we identified and the following greening categories: Wild Flowers areas, Urban Groves, Rain Gardens, and Dry Gardens. We provide planning and design tools as guidance for further exploration. Concepts and guidelines we define enrich the discussion on mobility-related green spaces and integrate the few indications and instances on landscaping at roundabouts reported in the literature.

AB  - The Falkland Islands (‘Falklands’) are home to half a million sheep that graze a marginal and drying landscape. This presents new challenges for the grazing management decisions that sustain farmers' livelihoods, lifestyles, and the surrounding natural environment. Our examination deploys Donella Meadows’ (1999; 2008) concept of leverage points to explore the ways farmers intervene to make transformations toward social and ecological sustainability within these systems. The most effective and lasting transformations—called ‘deep’ leverage points—require changes in system design, structure, and way of thinking (e.g. paradigm shifts); these contrast with more common and less impactful ‘shallow’ leverage points, which focus on basic system parameters (e.g. rates and numbers). Thematic analysis of interview and field data reveals that while all methods of sheep grazing involve ‘shallow’ leverage points such as managing livestock numbers and wool quality, Holistic Management (HM)—a rotational grazing method based in systems thinking—facilitates ‘deep’ leverage points for sustainable transformations. Careful planning, goal setting, and learning to think systemically enable HM farmers to make lasting transformations toward more sustainable wool production in the Falklands. Using leverage points as a framework, we explore the transformation potential of HM in this island community, and what this might mean for sustainable transformations in rangelands elsewhere.
