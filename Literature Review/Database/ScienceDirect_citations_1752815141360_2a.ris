AB  - Many cities currently focus on high-tech farming; but the future of urban food security depends on diverse strategies. Urban agriculture can take a variety of forms from small scale community gardens to medium scale urban farms to large scale food forests. Beyond the benefits of producing food and other resources, urban agriculture can be understood as a microsystem embedded in macro-scale economic, social, ecological and infrastructural systems of the city. This framing as embedded in the urban ‘system’ challenges cities to address urban agriculture not as a discrete activity, but as an important component of infrastructure and urban planning. I argue that there are innovative options across low to high tech approaches if we contextualize landscape types across the urban gradient. This chapter aims to categorize diverse opportunities across 10 landscape types for multifunctional urban land uses that integrate agriculture. Multifunctional land uses that integrate agriculturally productive landscapes will be a critical adaptation for the sustainability of future cities.

AB  - Almost all rural areas in Europe have been shaped or altered by humans and can be considered cultural landscapes, many of which now are considered to entail valuable cultural heritage. Current dynamics in land management have put cultural landscapes under a huge pressure of agricultural intensification and land abandonment. To prevent the loss of cultural landscapes, knowledge on the location of different types of cultural landscapes is needed. In this paper, we present a characterization of European cultural landscapes based on the prevalence of three key dimensions of cultural landscapes: landscape structure, management intensity, and value and meaning. We mapped these dimensions across Europe at a 1-km resolution by combining proxies on management intensity and landscape structure with new indicators such as social media usage and registered traditional food products. We integrated the three dimensions into a continuous “cultural landscape index” that allows for a characterization of Europe’s rural landscapes. The characterization identifies hotspots of cultural landscapes, where all three dimensions are present, such as in the Mediterranean. On the other hand, Eastern and Northern European cultural landscapes are mostly characterized by only one of the dimensions. Our paper can help to identify pressures to cultural landscapes and thus to target measures for the conservation of these landscapes, to link similar landscapes in different regions, and to inform policy design on the most important characteristics of cultural landscapes at a regional scale.

AB  - High Nature Value farmland (HNVf) are characterised by high naturalness of land cover and low intensity of agricultural practices. They are essential for biodiversity conservation in rural environments, and their presence is an important indicator of the effectiveness of different EU policies that aim to support biodiversity in agricultural areas. Consequently, their identification, protection and implementation is of strategic importance. Previous studies have analysed the landscape along an urban-rural-natural gradient, beginning with Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps. Building up from this baseline, this paper integrates spatial analysis methods with statistical data related to agricultural practices and their intensity, with the aim of mapping and assessing HNVf in a portion of the Veneto Plain, north-east Italy. In particular, this paper presents a methodology for the identification of HNVf applied to two datasets: (i) the first encompassing only LULC data and (ii) the second encompassing also statistical data on agricultural practices. The aim is to demonstrate how this additional information improves the identification of HNVf. In the first step, a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) technique is applied to a reclassified LULC map, in order to calculate continuous intensity indicators. A Principal Components Analysis and an ISODATA Cluster Analysis are then performed respectively to remove redundant information and to identify the different landscape structures of the study area. The second analysis follows the same steps, with the difference that LULC intensity indicators are analysed in combination with data on crop rotations, irrigation and livestock from a census survey. The first analysis returns a map of the landscape driven only by different intensities of land use. The second returns a map where the statistics on agricultural practices allow for a better characterisation of the natural value of the landscape. Agricultural statistics improved the results, since they allow the discrimination of lower intensity clusters within the cultivated areas, which are traditionally excluded from HNVf by considering only the land cover. The comparison between the results of the two analyses shows that the combined use of the agricultural statistics determines a more detailed representation of the study area, that allows a better differentiation of the agricultural areas between HNVf and non-HNVf, leading to an improvement of the HNVf identification methodology. The benefit of using additional information can be therefore of interest for territorial planning, with the ultimate aim of promoting biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Although Landscape Character Assessment (LCA) has gained a significant recognition around the globe, the understanding of the challenges faced by planners and decision- makers in incorporating LCA processes and outputs in land-use planning remains insufficient. This paper presents a snapshot of the barriers to effective LCA-based land-use planning in Israel, with regard to four distinct phases of the process: (a) the knowledge development phase, i.e., the formulation of a credible LCA approach; (b) the approach adoption phase, i.e., the willingness to incorporate LCA processes and outputs into land-use planning; (c) the knowledge transfer phase, i.e., the actual incorporation of LCA outputs into land-use planning; and (d) the application management phase, i.e., the transition of LCA- based plans into action. To investigate the barriers, the study combines a literature review with thematic analysis of eight Israeli LCA-based land-use plans from all planning levels, and individual in-depth interviews with 35 senior planners and decision makers involved in the design and implementation of these plans. The study reveals that within the general trajectory of mainstreaming LCA approach in Israel over the past two and a half decades, significant gaps exist between LCA knowledge, LCA-based land-use planning, and on- ground action and results. The extent of the gaps differs across plans and planning scales. The gaps are rooted in the complexity of the LCA approach; language barriers; scientific and technical limitations; inconsistency and subjectivity; different academic, planning, and decision-making traditions; limited institutional capacity; vagueness and over-flexibility of approved LCA-based planning principles and instructions; and lack of sufficient involvement by stakeholders. This paper offers suggestions as to how these gaps might be bridged in the Israeli context. In conclusion, the study recommends the following: developing a legally binding, generic, credible, and continuously updated LCA-based planning guide, that should be written in the native language; establishing a national and comprehensive free-access online information center for sharing LCA knowledge; strengthening of institutional capacities at all planning levels; enhancing planners' and consultants' LCA skills; and inclusion of all affected stakeholders in the process. Broadening the understanding of the obstacles and solutions to effective application of LCA processes and outputs in land-use planning and management practices can contribute to operationalizing this approach in various contexts and eventually, advance the reduction of anthropogenic pressures on valuable landscapes.

AB  - Economic growth in the nickel mining sector in Southeast Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, has accelerated development and population in Kendari City. The impact of increased immigration, transmigration, and urbanization increases the problem of deforestation to support the construction of people's homes in urban areas will result in damage to the ecosystem of the Wanggu River, Kendari City. This research uses geomorphology, demography, and ecology approaches to identify natural conditions with aerial photographs and satellite images (Google earth) simulated using ArcGis version 10.8. Then, it simulates the potential impact of flooding and pollution of the river environment due to the construction of people's houses around the riverside buffer. The study's findings reveal a discernible correlation between population growth and the heightened risk of ecological degradation within the river environment. The expansion of residential housing exerts significant stress on the river environment, resulting in the degradation of riparian areas and an increase in the river's pollution load. This deterioration in geomorphological, demographic, and ecological conditions within the river system has a direct and adverse impact on the overall health of the river ecosystem. Moreover, the results of the dynamics system simulation unequivocally indicate that river pollution is a persistent concern, with detrimental consequences extending to the mangrove area situated at the mouth of the Wanggu River, notably affecting pollution in Kendari Bay. The improvement of the built river area is useful for improving the landscape function of the river area, preventing erosion, and self-restoration of cities with rivers for ecological restoration, urban planning, and ecological management of urban landscapes in semi-arid areas with high rainfall intensity.

Eight datasets describing elevation, aspect, slope, soils, reconstructed natural vegetation, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and land cover were used. The method uses a modified TWINSAPN classification, measuring cluster heterogeneity using JUICE software, and defines a statistically significant diagnostic variable for each landscape type by calculating a measure of fidelity. This hierarchical approach combines statistical methods with GIS techniques, enabling instant visualisation and a further analysis of the results obtained. It is universal when zooming in on the landscape, though higher spatial resolution datasets are needed.

AB  - Evaluating visual landscape quality provides valuable information for urban development and spatial planning. In practice however, obtaining high resolution view-metrics and outcome data with sufficient geographic coverage has remained challenging. To overcome this limitation, we construct a scalable measure of visual landscape quality by first defining building-level view-metrics derived from a large-scale 3D representation of Switzerland’s building stock. Leveraging the principle of income-sorting, we estimate visual preferences by calibrating the building level view-metrics with commune-level incomes (CLI). The learned model captures common intuition on visual preferences, i.e. attributing positive weight to lake-views, and identifies context-dependent relationships between view metrics. To contextualize the derived quantitative measure, we refer to the preference for a building’s portfolio of viewpoints as a building’s visual capital (VC). By assessing the supply of VC across Switzerland’s entire building stock, we uncover an association between VC and the urban and natural form, where urban density and landscape topology explain the strength of view-driven-income sorting across agglomerations. We demonstrate that spatial clustering of VC varies across cities and frequently crosses administrative boundaries. Finally, we release a privacy protected version of VC at www.visualcapital.xyz, which we expect to promote future interdisciplinary studies focused on correlates of visual landscape quality (whether financial, social, environmental or physiological).

In the face of ongoing anthropogenic pressure and biodiversity loss, there is a need to protect nature more effectively. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive and consecutive approach utilising landscape ecological principles and methods for effective landscape protection and spatial nature conservation. Methods applicable in various conditions are exemplified through case studies from the Šumava National Park, the largest NP in Czechia. Using a set of spatial environmental, landscape ecological and geographical data we can:
Characterise the area of interest from the physical-geographical, socioeconomic, and management point of view to create the concept´s framework and review important background information for analysis of the area. Therefore, the key factors for landscape protection and biodiversity conservation are defined.
Analyse trends and processes of landscape dynamics in terms of land cover, landscape structure and habitat fragmentation and connectivity, which helps us to set main objectives of landscape protection and nature conservation.
Use data about environment conditions and key species and habitat occurrence to model habitat suitability, identify their suitable areas, and thus improve their protection. As a result, areas of high conservation value are distinguished.
Synthetize outputs of the above-mentioned steps and prioritise the target goals of landscape protection and biodiversity conservation in the area of interest. This leads to the effective zonation, which is a necessary condition for the application of appropriate management measures.

AB  - The crisis in traditional forest and farming activities that began in the second half of the 20th century has given way to a new territorial structure, characterised by greater forest density and an acceleration of urban sprawl, which has affected the impact of fires on the territory and especially on the inhabitants. The increased vulnerability of homes located at the wildland-urban interface (WUI) and the differences in the intensity of fire impact makes it necessary to identify different typologies of WUI zones. Characterization of WUI typologies was based on four forest fires with distinct characteristics, selected from fires that occurred in Catalonia in 2003 and 2012. Based on the different landscape units that have been studied and the dynamics of the changes that have occurred in the study area over the past 15 years, together with the occurrence of fires during this period, identified three major WUI zone typologies: a) metropolitan, b) agroforest and c) mountain agrosilvopastoral. The results, based on Kappa index and Rate of Change, show significant changes in Land Use and Land Cover between 2003 and 2009 in each study area, but the economic and social context in each region generated different territorial dynamics for each typology. This diagnosis contributes to knowledge that expands the available planning and management tools to mitigate the effects of wildfires.

AB  - Deforestation, degradation and regrowth of the tropical forests of the Amazon clearly alter forest cover. These changes in space and over time generate diverse landscape use (archetypes). Identifying the differences and similarities between units and associated changes in forest cover due to deforestation, degradation and regrowth is crucial for context-specific management and planning. Methods for quantitatively characterizing this complexity across large agricultural frontiers are still underdeveloped. This article presents a new method to study the archetypes resulting from forest cover changes in Amazonian subnational jurisdictions by integrating spatial and temporal analysis techniques for deforestation, degradation and regrowth. The weighted k-means approach was linked to nine metrics covering the period 1990–2021 in three subnational jurisdictions of the Brazilian and Colombian Amazon: 1. baseline forest, 2. percentage forest loss, 3. remaining forest, 4. speed of forest loss, 5. active deforestation, 6. percentage forest degradation, 7. speed of forest degradation, 8. active degradation, and 9. percentage regrowth. Four optimal archetypes were chosen using k-means classification: a. consolidated frontier, b. vulnerable frontier, c. past gradual frontier and d. rampant frontier. Consolidated frontiers are areas with high and long term deforestation. Vulnerable frontiers have high forest cover but show signs of previous or recent deforestation and degradation. Past gradual and rampant frontiers show medium to high levels of deforestation associated with degradation. The importance and spatial distribution of each archetype varies at a territorial scale depending on colonization history and on the drivers of deforestation and degradation. This approach provides valuable insights for stakeholder to target interventions and policies adapted to each archetype, for example, payment for ecosystem services, command and control policies, land tenure regulations, land restoration strategies or land use intensification.

AB  - Sustainability has become an important discussion topic across the world since the late 1980s. However, there is still lack of knowledge about the landscape sustainability and its quantitative evaluation, especially at local and regional scale levels. The sustainable development of the Chinese Loess Plateau has always been a focus in China mainly because of the occurring severe soil erosion. This study investigates the changes of the landscape pattern and the changes of the ecological sustainability of the agricultural landscapes in Ansai County between 1980 and 2000, which is located in the northern part of the Chinese Loess Plateau. Using a landscape typology as a spatial reference framework, the concept of hemeroby was used, in a multidisciplinary approach, for the assessment of the ecological aspect of agricultural landscape sustainability. We combined expert judgement with a regression model and a Geographic Information System. Fourteen variables describing the landscape structure were chosen as predictors for hemeroby. The research showed that the major changes in the agricultural landscape pattern were caused not only by socio-economic factors but also by the government policies over the past two decades, such as the large-scale eco-environment conservation programmes starting in the late of the 20th century. One of these programmes is known as the Grain-for-Green Programme (initiated in 1999). Between 1980 and 2000, the proportion of cropland-dominated landscape sharply decreased while the percentage of the mixed farmland–grassland landscape and the mixed farmland–woodland–grassland landscape increased. Meanwhile, the ecological sustainability of the agricultural landscape as a whole tended to become more sustainable, except a few landscape types. Among variables describing landscape pattern, patch size standard deviation (PSSD), total edge (TE), mean shape index (MSI), landscape shape index (LSI) and Shannon's evenness index (SEI) were shown to be the significant predicators for hemeroby. Although some data limitation, landscape structure turned out to be a good predicator for land use intensity and ecological sustainability of agricultural landscape estimated by hemeroby. As a highly integrative indicator, the concept of hemeroby provides a framework for the comparison of different land use pattern.

AB  - In this paper, we present a quantified, GIS-based analysis of the relationship between urban morphological patterns and racial, ethnic, and household characteristics. We want to understand how the built landscapes of American cities differ in sociological terms—for example, are some more prone to racial concentration or prevalence of particular family types? Since many built landscape types are relatively recent and rapidly growing, this analysis can inform current debates about sprawl and inequality. We examined six diverse U.S. metropolitan regions: Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, Portland, and Sacramento, joining census block data with built landscape patterns mapped in GIS through aerial imagery analysis. We find that a large portion of our six metropolitan regions consists of patterns that can be characterized as sprawl—patterns that are often manifestations of a desire for separation. This separation has significant equity implications because resources—services, amenities, schools, parks, tax base, etc.—are not evenly distributed. Further, two of our patterns (Rural Sprawl and Upscale Enclave), which are growing rapidly and most often occur on the urban fringe, have the least diverse demographics across all six metro areas. These landscapes are also by far the least dense, leading to a range of negative environmental impacts. Older built landscape types (Urban Grids, Rectangular Block Grids, and Degenerate Grids) are denser and relatively diverse. These have lower rates of occupancy in most urban areas, indicating an opportunity to house additional residents in relatively well-located, well-connected, and diverse central portions of metropolitan regions.

AB  - Recent scholarship has focused on the sprawling landscape development patterns occurring across the US and the array of local planning and development management reforms advocated in response. This paper critiques the use of content analysis for evaluating local master plans and zoning codes in the context of those advocated reforms. I first discuss the adaptation of content analysis for evaluating plans and codes, and I argue that scholars need to have clear expectations about what functions a plan serves to make their evaluations meaningful. I characterize the plan as a “communicative policy act” and argue that the communicative content of that act (its policy focus) should be distinguished from the way in which that content is conveyed (its quality). I then characterize the larger policy context that frames recent scholarship on local planning and development management as the desire to reform local efforts to promote “neo-traditional landscapes.” Building on these discussions, I present an array of criteria for evaluating local master plans and zoning codes. I conclude by presenting findings from an analysis of plans and codes in central Michigan and discussing the use of content analysis for evaluating plans and codes in light of those findings.

AB  - Canalized rivers are often the product of urbanization. They are an important component of urban blue-green infrastructure whose visual landscape quality affects the aesthetics of a city. Existing research on urban waterways pays little attention to urban canalized rivers and lacks a quantitative interpretation of their visual quality. This study aims to simulate human visual perception and establish quantifiable landscape features for urban riverside greenways. Using a deep learning model to build connections between landscape features and the aesthetic preference of riverside spaces, we establish the best predictive model for the aesthetic quality of urban canalized riverside greenways. We use panoramic photos of rivers in central Beijing and image semantic segmentation technology to extract physical features of landscape composition. We use an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model and a random forest (RF) model to develop a predictive model for riverside aesthetic quality. The RF model was found to be the most accurate for predicting the aesthetic quality score of the channelized riverside. Trees and bridges are the most important input factors that affect the output score of the RF model. Trees are positively correlated with aesthetic quality, while bridges are negatively correlated. In practice, this model can be used for batch evaluation and aesthetic quality prediction of urban canalized riverside landscapes to help practitioners improve analysis efficiency and guide the management and planning of riverside landscapes.

AB  - With the acceleration of urbanization, ensuring equitable access (or accessibility) to peri-urban parks for residents has become a key issue in landscape and urban planning. Traditional studies on peri-urban park accessibility often lack a comprehensive evaluation of the supply and demand for peri-urban parks and traffic conditions. Taking Chengdu as an example, this study develops an improved two-step floating catchment area method that integrates traffic conditions. It dynamically assesses accessibility to peri-urban parks at different times during weekends and spatial inequalities, as well as explores the relationship between these inequalities and traffic conditions. The results indicate that under a 60-minute time threshold, there is significant two-tier differentiation in accessibility to peri-urban parks in Chengdu, with significant differences between different time points. Particularly during periods of traffic congestion, the issue of accessibility inequality becomes more prominent. This phenomenon highlights a strong correlation between congestion levels on routes to parks and inequality in park accessibility. This study provides a novel perspective and methodology for dynamically evaluating and optimizing accessibility to peri-urban parks, providing empirical evidence for urban planners in the planning of peri-urban parks and the design of transportation systems. This study emphasizes the need for comprehensive and proactive measures in the planning process to alleviate the adverse effects of traffic congestion on accessibility to peri-urban parks.

AB  - Wetlands fulfil a number of functions in the landscape, especially non-productive ones. Information on landscape and biotope changes is important not only from a theoretical point of view for understanding the forces and pressures that cause changes in the landscape, but also from a practical point of view, as we can take inspiration from history when planning the landscape. The main goal of this study is to analyse the dynamics and trajectories of changes in wetlands, including testing the influence of the main natural conditions (climate, geomorphology) on their changes, for a large area of 141 cadastral territories (1315 km2), which will allow the results to be sufficiently generalized. The results of our study confirmed the global trend of rapid wetland loss, with almost three quarters of wetlands disappearing, mostly on arable land (37 %). The results of the study are of great importance in the field of the ecology of landscapes and wetlands, both in the national and international context, not only because they make it possible to understand the regularities and forces that affect changes in wetlands and landscapes, but also have significance due to the methodology. The specific methodology and procedure are based on the application of advanced GIS functions (Union and Intersect functions) to identify the location and area of individual change dynamics and types of wetland (new, extinct, continuous), using accurate old large-scale maps and aerial photographs. The proposed and tested methodological procedure can generally be used for wetlands in other locations, but also for studying the dynamics of changes and trajectories of other biotopes in the landscape. The greatest potential for using the results of this work in the field of environmental protection is the possibility of using the places of extinct wetlands for their restoration.

AB  - Sustainability has become a central term in environmental planning and policy since the late 1980s. However, an understanding of landscapes in terms of sustainability is still poorly developed. The project Spatial Indices for Land Use Sustainability was conducted to elaborate spatially explicit indicators for mapping ecological sustainability. Ecological sustainability was defined in terms of naturalness and biodiversity. The concept of hemeroby, a measure for the naturalness or conversely the human influence on ecosystems, was used for the assessment of ecological sustainability. Because direct information on the hemerobiotic state of landscapes was missing, shortcuts were analysed. An interdisciplinary multi-scale approach was developed that combined remote sensing data and a landscape ecological field survey, using a landscape typology as spatial reference frame. Variables describing the configuration and shape of the land mosaic were derived form a land cover classification based on landform and landscape fragmentation data. Two different assessment approaches were compared, (a) an expert-knowledge based fuzzy-rule system, and (b) an assessment based on the deviation of a certain landscape type from the mean hemerobiotic state. The hemeroby model was formulated and applied using ordinal regression techniques. The project results support the ‘pattern and process paradigm’. Variables describing landscape patterns turned out to be crucial for the model and were a good predictor for land-use intensity estimated by the hemerobiotic state. Based on each of the two approaches a ‘sustainability map’ of Austria's cultural landscapes was derived. Despite the methodological differences of the two approaches similarities in the results could be demonstrated. Landscape-structure indicators were shown to be good indicators of ecological sustainability because they are related to ecological characteristics of landscapes such as naturalness and biodiversity.

AB  - To address multifunctional land-use management, and as a response to societal expectations with regard to agriculture and well-being in rural spaces, one of the aspects in need of particular attention in the current research is the spatial expression of the landscape attractiveness. Current knowledge about the attributes of landscape that are most highly appreciated, and the ways that individual differences may influence landscape preferences, is still incomplete, particularly for complex agricultural landscapes in the Mediterranean. The aim of this paper is to provide an assessment, including quantitative and qualitative approaches, of user-based landscape preferences in the Mediterranean region of Alentejo, Southern Portugal. To allow for the spatial expression of these preferences and the evaluation of the impact of changes to land-use, specific land cover classes have been used as the basis for our survey. The results are aimed at adding to the body of research literature on the diversity of the landscape attributes that are valued by different user groups and at contributing to informed decision-making processes when resolving land-use issues in the region being studied. To attain this objective, a photo-questionnaire was conducted to identify preferred land cover classes and the land cover qualities that landscape users appreciate most. The study shows that the way that landscape is used is a significant factor influencing the preferences, following a clear functional demand pattern. Not only are there differences between land managers as producers and others as consumers, but the appreciated land cover qualities and land cover preferences also differ from one consumer group to another. Knowledge regarding the preferences of specific groups can inform landscape management at different levels of governance in such a way that multi-functionality may be more successfully attained. Moreover, certain particularities with regard to the preferred landscapes in the region being studied are discussed in comparison with the results of earlier studies from other regions. In this regard, this paper puts great weight on the importance of territorial contextualization in regard to making general assessments concerning landscape preferences.

AB  - This research investigates the UK citizens’ perceptions of the ecosystem services (ES) created using a range of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in urban green spaces (UGS). The longevity of the ES derived from UGS is dependent on the effective on-going maintenance of urban landscapes, therefore this paper also gathers data on direct UGS participation specifically through the lens of civic stewardship to assess the impact of such schemes upon ES. NBS typologies were created and used, in the mixed methods study, to gauge perceptions of and preferences for alternative urban landscape design. The UGS survey collected data from 345 respondents on ES and the NBS typologies. Twelve semi-structured interviews provide qualitative data on NBS typology preferences, perceptions, and understanding of ES as well as motivations behind civic engagement in UGS in the UK. Stewardship programmes were found to increase community resilience by providing additional ES. The results showed a preference for integrating complex, multifunctional UGS into the fabric of urban centres to ensure accessibility and to maximise engagement. More complex NBS typologies were perceived to provide additional ES when compared with traditional monoculture mown grass and shrub amenity planting. Mixed native planting and Tiny Forest NBS typologies were perceived as providing more provisioning, cultural, regulating, and supporting ES. Considering both UK citizens' perceptions of the ES gained from alternative NBS and stewardship schemes in UGS represents a holistic approach that can improve the design and management of NBS in cities. This study is the first to explore both concepts in the UK and suggests a holistic UGS approach to address urban challenges, including those related to Climate Change.

AB  - Landscape character assessment (LCA) can outline the distinctions between landscapes and aid in identifying and preserving a sense of place, with the core result being landscape character (LC) mapping. Despite LCA being popular, challenges, such as a single LC factor structure and its inherent and subjective selection, remain. LC identification methods are constantly being updated; however, limitations by sample size, data type, and lack of object-specificity remain to be addressed. In this study, the traditional LC factor was defined as the part of the factor component based on which the configuration and coordinate factors were introduced to construct the 3C structure of the LC composition. Considering the area along the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the bottom-up induction method was used to screen the five composition factors and their weight with a greater influence on the rural landscape through CATREG, and obtained 329 types of landscape description units and 382,279 characterized patches through fuzzy superposition. K-prototype clustering with improved weighting and elbow method coding was introduced to determine the optimal K-value for the 106 LC types. Boundary identification and unique segmentation using eCognition yielded 456 LC areas. Using a top-down deductive approach combined with an overall landscape view, the three types and seven LC zones were obtained using large-scale geohydrological name types and categorized by the LC area as a boundary. Three aspects of the LCA identification stage were improved: composition of LC factors, assignment of LC factor weights, and improvement of identification techniques and methods to construct a more comprehensive, accurate, and geographically specific LC identification system.

AB  - Amenity horticulture, also referred to as ‘landscape’ or ‘environmental’ horticulture, is the cultivation of plants in the landscape for aesthetic or functional purposes. This sector exploits an extensive range of plant species and their cultivated forms (>60000 genotypes). It encompasses green landscape typologies such as sport and leisure turf; street or garden trees; and urban forests, shrub, herbaceous; or annual ‘bedding’ plant borders, green walls, and roofs and designed ‘naturalized’ meadows. Originally, amenity horticulture dealt with largely aesthetic aspects of green space, but increasingly its use is defined by the functions (eco-system services) that are provided by such vegetation and related landscapes. This includes contributions to urban cooling, biodiversity conservation, mitigation of air pollution, and reducing rates of precipitation run-off and flash flooding, as well as providing opportunities for enhanced ‘sense of place’ and human health and well-being.

AB  - Community gardens are increasingly implemented in cities and considered in public policies regarding the range of expected benefits they can provide. Much research has indeed emphasized their roles for community gardens members, but little research still concerns residents’ perspectives. In this paper, we explored the importance of these gardens for residents. More specifically, we assessed the knowledge, the perception and the participation of residents in the gardens. We conducted a questionnaire survey in the neighborhood of nine community gardens in Paris, France. We found that less than forty percent out of the 431 respondents know the activities going on in the nearby garden, and that these people were more often already engaged in civic initiatives. However, nearly hundred percent of interviewed people had a good perception of the gardens, based on their role in providing urban green spaces, in promoting contact with people and education. Finally, twenty percent declared frequent participation. Residents’ perceptions and participation in community gardens depended on individuals’ life experiences and involvement in biodiversity and civic initiatives. Our results highlight that city dwellers are aware of the benefits that community gardens can provide to them, to their neighborhood and to the city as a whole. These results confirm that community gardens are extremely important places to consider in urban planning and policy making, as well as in conservation research.

AB  - Only a few decades have passed since when in Italy spatial planning considered the countryside as an indistinct “blank space” only deserving marginal attentions. At the same time it is well known that the outcomes of the spatial and economic planning systems developed and tested over the past decades have been showing their critical poor suitability compared to the complexity of the socioeconomic system, which calls for specific planning policies, differentiated according to the various features, vocations, expressions and attitudes of the countryside. Therefore, the rural space experienced a long time after urban areas the use of specific spatial planning criteria aimed at a well-ordered, efficient, and sustainable development and a better quality of the settlement system, crucial issues which still wait for thorough and final answers. Moreover, the following issues have become more and more topical: the importance of defining specific planning policies for rural areas, and the need to go beyond the identification of zones to be intended for a specific and homogeneous type of development, by carrying out an ever more focussed and proper classification of rural areas. This paper reports the results of a critical discussion about the above-mentioned themes. The work is part of a broader research dealing with the development of a research model aimed to define a new idea of “spatial units”, meant as analytical and design tools suitable to support syntheses of land-use, economic, agricultural, and landscape planning.

AB  - Two thirds of Canadians reside in urban areas and 85% of recent population growth occurs in these areas. The intensity and duration of extreme hot weather events are predicted to increase in Canadian cities and in cities globally. It is well established that human suffering due to extreme heat is exacerbated in urban as compared to rural environments. Understanding the characteristics of urban landscapes that play the greatest roles in exacerbating the human health impact of extreme heat is thus imperative. This study explores the relationship between the amount of canopy cover from trees and the incidence of heat-related morbidity during extreme heat events in 544 neighbourhoods of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Four extreme heat events from three years were studied. Heat-related ambulance calls were found to be 12.3% higher during the heat events than in the preceding or the following week. The number of heat-related ambulance calls was negatively correlated to canopy cover (Spearman Rank rho=−0.094, p=0.029) and positively correlated to hard surface cover (Spearman Rank rho=0.150, p<0.001). Toronto neighbourhoods, as defined by Census Tracts, with less than 5% canopy cover had approximately five times as many heat-related calls as those with greater than 5% tree canopy cover, and nearly fifteen times as many heat-related calls as Census Tracts with greater than 70% tree canopy cover. These data suggest that even a marginal increase in the tree canopy cover from <5% to >5% could reduce heat-related ambulance calls by approximately 80%. These results have important implications for human health during heat events, particularly in the context of global climate change and urban heat islands, both of which are trending toward hotter urban environments in future.

We quantify the current spatial relationship between nature and society, and we include legacy effects from the most recent period of armed conflict and its consequences of forced displacement and land use disruption. The procedure followed provides a quantitative model where a minimum number of socio-economic and political variables explain the variation in land cover. The results represent the relationship between land use intensity and the main socio-economic and political indicators, highlighting a close interaction between landscape configuration, socio-economic structure of local populations, coercive conservation and armed conflict. A simulated post-conflict landscape shows a clear transition gradient towards agrarian expansion and intensification, also in systems where naturalness is a relevant feature. The peace process in Colombia offers opportunities for new schemes of land planning and management, including natural resource governance and policy reforms to improve welfare and resilience of local communities. The results allow to define options for future planning given the possible consequences of socio-political legacy effects yet to fully play out across Colombia.

AB  - Mountain cultural landscapes of southern Europe have been affected during the 20th century by significant land use changes, due to depopulation and abandonment of traditional agro-silvo-pastoral practices. In addition, the cessation of traditional forest management led to a homogenization of forest structures and to the loss of habitats. Italy is one of the European countries most affected by the consequences of depopulation of mountain areas. Moscheta is located in the Italian Apennines, in Tuscany, and its economy has been based for centuries on forests (for timber, firewood, charcoal, and chestnuts to produce flour) and livestock. The aim of the paper is to analyze the land use changes occurred in a typical forest mountain landscape of southern Europe in the last 191 years, and to describe the characteristics and the results of the Forest Landscape Restoration project recently implemented. The methodology is based on GIS-based spatial analyses comparing the landscape of 1832, 2013 and 2023. In the period 1832–2013, 45% of the total surface was affected by forestation (average rate of 1.9 ha/year) mainly due to the abandonment of pastures and wooded pastures, but also to direct conifer afforestation. Chestnut groves were abandoned as they were no more economically interesting. From the 2010s, a Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) project was implemented considering the economical, technical and future management feasibility. It focused on recovering the monumental chestnut groves and the wooded pastures, but also on interventions to increase the touristic attractiveness (paths management, Historical Landscape Museum creation, traditional buildings for chestnut drying restoration). The area was also inscribed in 2016 in the National list of Historical Rural Landscape established by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture. The analyses of the 2013–2023 landscape changes demonstrated that 4 ha of historical chestnut groves and 6.5 ha of wooded pastures have been recently restored, bringing their total surface to 17 ha and to 67 ha, respectively. In addition, results demonstrate that forestation completely stopped in the last 10 years. Other interventions are planned for the future: maintenance of chestnut groves, rehabilitation of other wooded pastures, re-introduction of the traditional practice of pollarding on ten beech trees. This study represents the first assessment of the FLR carried out in Moscheta, and demonstrates that the restoration of open spaces and of cultural forests is possible and could have a big impact on mountain cultural landscapes, contributing to the preservation and enhancement of ecosystem services and of touristic attractiveness, with potential direct benefits on the local economy.

AB  - This paper addresses how strategic spatial planning is considering urban tourism, a phenomenon that has an increasing impact on the development of cities. A research approach interlinking urban tourism and spatial planning is conceptualised based on responsiveness theory and applied to a case study of ten medium-sized Central European cities. Descriptive statistical analysis of the presence of tourism in cities and policy analysis of strategic spatial planning documents enable a comparison analysis of the level of consideration of tourism alongside screening of proposed tourism-related measures. The paper reveals that strategic spatial planning documents are not responsive enough to tourism growth, and there is a lack of strategic measures steering towards sustainable tourism development in cities.

AB  - National parks provide a considerable number of co-benefits to society, including the balance of ecosystems, conservation of heritage values, and tourism. However, studies on zoning approaches for the management of national parks are lacking. The landscape characterization approach is a holistic method for identifying regional landscapes and helps improve zoning management, thus promoting sustainable planning. Here, we propose a landscape character classification (LCC) approach for national parks by integrating a k-means clustering algorithm and geographic information system (GIS). We used Laoshan National Park (LNP) as a case study and aimed to (1) quantify the major landscape factors (altitude, topography relief, soil type, and heritage impact intensity) that influence the landscape classification of mountainous protected areas; (2) create a map of landscape character types and areas to guide a zoning boundary; and (3) further examine how decision makers assign different conservation strategies to each landscape character area. Our results indicate that different landscape character areas reflect distinct ecological environments and heritage values and that differentiated zoning management can effectively mitigate the impact of natural disasters and human activities. Our study suggests that national parks require scientific landscape character zoning, rational descriptions of landscape character types, and targeted management measures to achieve the dual objectives of zoning and landscape conservation.

AB  - The indicators of climate change—atmospheric CO2 concentrations, temperature increase, Arctic sea ice melting, deglaciation, sea level rise, ocean acidification, species extinction rate, among others— are not progressing linearly but exponentially, unlike many older assumptions including IPCC models. Massive action is needed, and in order to enable it, an understanding what actions are needed to achieve rapid and comprehensive Change. The Space Time and Renewables (STAR) model has the ability to model and map on GIS platforms such time variable scenarios for regions, cities, towns, and neighborhoods. We have developed it for the Lake Constance Alpine-Rhine Energy (LACE) Region to not only test when and how it can become entirely independent energetically, whether it can sequester more atmospheric carbon than it emits, and how much financial value creation can be achieved—but also to demonstrate our model’s ability to test time sensitive scenarios. The time horizons applied here—2010 to 2030 to 2050—are modeled on older, Kyoto-Protocol and IPCC-type assumptions. These are wholly inadequate today—and far too distant to be helpful. The study was also developed prior to the Paris Accord of 2016; hence we still speak of the already then-illusory 2 degree/450ppm limits—illusory because both values were set far too high for the survival of the human species. Hence, we show the principle of STAR’s time sensitive modeling and scenario planning in this chapter—looking forward to applications with much shorter time frames and more rapid action horizons appropriate to the planetary emergency we are in. The investigation concludes that the LACE region not only has the potential to become carbon neutral, but even to become a CO2 sink that binds more carbon than it emits. The investments into the transformation process were assessed and juxtaposed with the fossil/nuclear energy savings. A shift of the systematic differential costs in time can be observed: initially the energy costs will rise, but in the longer term—from 2030 onwards—they will begin to fall dramatically. The savings gained from avoiding fossil and nuclear energy can be invested within the region to generate jobs and prosperity.

AB  - China’s national parks adopt a resource-oriented protection and planning approach that cannot restrain the continuous landscape fragmentation and deterioration, whereas, we propose to characterise the landscape in order to protect its integrity. This paper described a hierarchical identification of landscape character types and areas in Lushan National Park and its fringes according to a refined combination of the parametric and the holistic methods in a multiscalar approach. In terms of the functional hierarchy of landscape character, we decided to order the available data sources in ‘downscaling’. At the broad scale, landscape typologies were delimited by raster datasets of four natural attributes: land cover, soil, vegetation, and altitude. At the intermediate scale, landscape typologies were determined by raster datasets of six natural and cultural attributes: aspect, slope, relief amplitude, heritage density, geology and land use. At these two scales, we adopted the principal component analysis (PCA) and two-step cluster analysis in SPSS software to visualise landscape types, to modify and integrate the results obtained in the eCognition software, as well as to rectify the visualisation with manual identifications. At the detailed scale, landscape typologies were demarcated by two raster and one vector datasets of cultural attributes: building density, visual influence and time depth. We performed the visualisation and integration with a similar method except for the PCA step. This multi-scaled identification will provide a nested framework facilitating the integration of the broad Lushan region in both spatial and administrative dimensions.

AB  - The importance placed by policy-makers on cultural ecosystem services (CES) is on the rise worldwide, inducing a growing interest in the development of innovative approaches for their mapping, characterization, and assessment. Previous studies have shown how the analysis of the content of geotagged images shared on social media can be used to shed a light on CES provision and consumption without having to resort to time-consuming surveys and interviews. However, to make this approach viable over large study areas, the image classification process must be automatized and new developments of deep learning field have the potential to do so. To evaluate this potential, we have gathered over 91,000 images acquired within British Columbia (Canada) provincial parks system and then trained and deployed convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify them. Images were classified based on: (i) their relevance in the context of CES research; (ii) the type of CES depicted (aesthetic or recreation); and (iii) the type of aesthetic experience or recreational activity depicted; with an estimated accuracy of 85 %. Then we combined the outcomes of the image classification process with images metadata to assess the value of the recreational ecosystem service provided by the most popular parks with an innovative crowdsourced benefit transfer approach, obtaining values that range from the 105.2 M CAN$ of Cypress park to the 0.3 M CAN$ of Lac du Bois park. Our findings show how crowdsourced social media images, coupled with the new developments of deep learning, offer to ecosystem managers across the world the opportunity of gathering cheap, fine scale, and comprehensive information about CES. Finally, we address the limitations and future perspectives of automated image classification for CES research.

AB  - Ecological impairment is prevalent in built environment and habitat enrichment had begun in cities globally. Most commendable ecological landscaping initiatives are, however, centred around developed countries in temperate region. Thus the systemic approaches may be inept to capture and reflect the natural processes in tropical regions. This paper describes a novel attempt to address the deficiency by developing and testing the idea of using birds as a proxy to drive ecological landscaping in tropical cities. A range of a priori avifauna metrics were applied to measure the biophysical complexity of six exemplar strata in inner and periphery areas of Ipoh city, Malaysia. Data collected were analysed and the metrics were able to reflect biophysical complexity in each stratum, statistically. Additionally, a numerical rating index from "impaired" (0) to "excellent" (100) was also inferred from two reference strata, or "best performers", to provide urban landscape planners with a standardized comparative measure. Numerous intricacies emerging from the "best performers" are highlighted to inform ecological landscape planning and biomimicry design. The implications to the public, policymakers and other stakeholders are also succinctly discussed. The key strength of the system, known as the Avifauna-based Biophysical Index (ABI), is it fosters learning from nature. The system is open to the views of the local stakeholders and sensitive to the realities given that the benchmarks consider regional ecological and anthropogenic variability. The principles of the ABI system are universal since it does not advocate a "one size fits all" resolution. Hence, although the proof of concept was demonstrated in Ipoh, the ABI system is applicable to tropical cities elsewhere.

AB  - The traditional use of land for food, fuel and wood created cultural landscapes, which are threatened across Europe. The factors which contributed to their endangerment need to be identified to achieve effective preservation of such landscapes. The aim of our study was to identify landscapes with historical persistence in a GIS-based comparative analysis of historical and contemporary maps and the most prominent causes of the past landscape changes, based on stakeholders' perspective. We considered a case study in Romania's Carpathians. Three major land cover types were extracted from maps dating from 1912, 1980 and 2009: built-up, pastures and forests. The historical persistence of all land cover types was poor (<20%) and profound changes were quantitatively confirmed. Large, compact patches of unchanged forests were located in the neighbourhood of a national park. The persistent pastures were situated close to human settlements, and their preservation can be related to local traditional agro-silvo-pastoral management. Although the built-up area has increased over time, the corresponding surfaces are small and consist of scattered patches located around historical monuments. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate stakeholders' perspective. Using cluster analysis five prominent causes of past landscape changes are identified: 'increasing tourism', 'land tenure and social changes', 'land-use intensification', 'post-communist transition', and 'foreign investments'. We join the results of the GIS analysis with those from stakeholders' perspective to gain more insights into the landscape changes. This research offers important information that could be used for the further planning of these valuable cultural landscapes in order to avoid potential conflicts and degradation.

AB  - Water utilities incentivize turf replacement to promote water conservation, but the effects of such programs have received limited evaluations. In 2014, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) undertook an unprecedented investment to incentive turf replacement throughout Southern California in response to a serious Statewide drought. MWD devoted $350 million to the program, resulting in more than 46,000 rebate payments (25,000 in Los Angeles County) to remove 15.3 million square meters of turf. The program implementation provided a unique opportunity to address research gaps on turf replacement implementation. We analyzed socioeconomic and spatial trends of program participants and assessed landscape changes from turf replacement using a random sample of properties (4% of LA County participants in 2014–16). Specifically, we used a novel and cost-effective approach Google Earth Street View to characterize landscapes in front yards and created a typology of land cover types. Results showed: post-replacement landscapes had a diversity of land cover types – diverse yards with several land cover types, as well as more homogenous yards with a single land cover such as woodchips, bare soil, gravel, and artificial turf. Analysis also indicated some evidence of “neighborhood adoption” effects. We describe the need for longitudinal studies to understand long-term effects of turf replacement and associated water use, and suggest that water utilities should also evaluate results in backyards, which requires site visits. This study provides a novel contribution that can be replicated over space and time to further knowledge of turf replacement program implementations and evaluation.

AB  - Hills, G.A., 1974. A philosophical approach to landscape planning. Landscape Plann., 1: 339–371. This paper presents the thesis that in spite of the valuable contribution which science, art and technology make in analysing problems in landscape planning, a philosophical perspective is required for their practical resolution. This approach is not that of a philosopher whose aim is to expound a thesis which he considers to be relevant to planning, but rather that of a planner who would gather from a number of schools some fundamental concepts upon which to erect a useful philosophical structure. The peculiar nature of the land use units into which landscape must be differentiated necessitates an investigational framework which provides for the ecological classification and interpretation of the characteristics of those units. The framework needed is an organization of land use units as human ecosystems developing in space and time and a procedure for investigating the complex interrelationships within this space-time matrix. The nature of the ecosystem is said to be peculiar in that the transactional relationships between component features of the ecosystem cannot be investigated fully by the traditional scientific methods. Transactional refers to that special kind of interaction which is conditioned not only by the two features in apparent interaction but by the nature of the whole ecosystem. The contribution which the logician Dewey and his associate made in introducing the concept of transactional behaviour into enquiry has been outlined. The author also discusses the restrictions which Dewey imposed on the application of his logic to land use investigations in recognizing only inductive and deductive inferences and by despising intuition. A type of inference (iterative) is outlined which the author has introduced to explain his own research in the typing and evaluation of biotic ecosystems. Values of the relative fitness of the match between the biotic community and its non-living environment, are obtained not only by simple inductive and deductive inference alone but by the iterative inference described in the paper. The author also examines several areas of relative ‘goodness’ which have been postulated as constituting an optimum human environment. The author discusses the conflict of values owing to the many types of goodnesses which have been brought under the ‘ethic’ umbrella. He further discusses the manner in which the cosmic order philosophy of Dooyeweerd not only provides an interlocking scale of goodness in which values of higher or lower orders may be anticipated or viewed in retrospect but also the philosophical structure within which the final decision can be made. Examples are presented to illustrate the way in which philosophy helps the decision-maker by disclosing the significance of the impacts of alternative land uses in an organized way. The roles of life view philosophies in decision making are also introduced. In order to present the planning process as a unified whole, a transdisciplinary model of six levels of formulation has been introduced. The formulation at each level is both a ‘particular’, in relation to the formulation above it, and a ‘situation’ which provides meaning for the particular formulated at the level below. This linkage is provided by differing forms of enquiry which bind the disciplinary levels together at the various interlevels.

AB  - Analysing landscape units and their characteristics is essential for understanding the interaction between landscape assessment and land use policy. By identifying the groups, types and sub-types of landscape character units, we attempt to qualify the characteristics and values of the landscape in the municipality of Popielów, Poland. Due to a variety of natural and cultural heritages in the research area, land use policy requires a holistic approach, and preserving landscape values remains a top preservation task. Priority landscapes were calculated by assessing three evaluation criteria: unique cultural values, unique natural values and representativeness. The results showed that land use policy and development plans have negative, neutral and positive impacts on priority landscapes. Negative impacts largely occurred on agricultural landscapes through the introduction of new functions, such as the area of exploitation, service buildings and production facilities. Neutral impacts included new residential housing, tourism services and production in small villages. Positive changes in the landscape included the expansion and increased connectivity of forest areas.

AB  - Bluegreen infrastructure (BGI) combines hydrological measures and various socioecological functions and is being increasingly acknowledged as a means of promoting climate-resilient cities. Unlike ordinary familiar landscapes and typical underground conventional drainage infrastructure types, BGI is visible as a critical part of urban landscapes. However, studies analysing human BGI perception and preference for distinctive visual BGI appearance are still scarce. Using two cities (Dublin, Ireland and Xi’an, China) with different sociocultural and geographic contexts as case studies, human responses to BGI were studied by developing a photo comparison experiment (PCE) leveraging 15 visual stimuli that reflect five BGI dimensions. The main findings demonstrate that 1) stronger perceived naturalness is preferred over reduced perceived naturalness in BGI, but an excessive sense of naturalness can result in a lower preference for BGI; 2) the preference for perceived naturalness implied in BGI is associated with the perception of BGI landscape component value; and 3) there is a discrepancy between the preference pattern (personal preference with affective reaction) and the acceptance pattern (cognitive or rational understanding of the suitability of BGI implementation based on nonaffective reactions). By generating place-specific knowledge and comparisons, this study contributes to the planning, design and management of urban BGI in Dublin and Xi'an and highlights the need to consider the specificities of each city in BGI design and management, providing insights for other cities in these regions facing the need for wider BGI implementation.

AB  - In this study, a methodology for the assessment and mapping of landscape naturalness integrity, in terms of disturbance of naturalness directly perceived by humans, is proposed. We introduce an integrated geographic index of landscape naturalness, consisted of four composite criteria and developed by using open geospatial data, multicriteria decision analysis, and geographic information systems. The composite criteria (environmental, acoustic, visual, and aesthetic criterion) were assigned values by a set of variables to produce an elaborate interpretation of landscape naturalness. The proposed method is designed to assess landscape naturalness index at national level and take into account the complexity of Mediterranean landscapes; it was tested in the case of Greece. The outputs revealed that the majority of Greece’s surface area is characterized by landscapes of low and moderate naturalness. The accuracy of the results was evaluated by using sampling points of Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS), and it was found to be quite satisfactory. The proposed methodology may constitute a powerful tool for supporting landscape planning, rural policy planning, and policy making for nature conservation.

AB  - Anthropogenic impacts on the aquatic environment, especially in the context of nutrients, provide a major challenge for water resource management. The heterogeneous nature of policy relevant management units (e.g. catchments), in terms of environmental controls on nutrient source and transport, leads to the need for holistic management. However, current strategies are limited by current understanding and knowledge that is transferable between spatial scales and landscape typologies. This study presents a spatially-explicit framework to support the modelling of nutrients from land to water, encompassing environmental and spatial complexities. The framework recognises nine homogeneous landscape units, distinct in terms of sensitivity of nutrient losses to waterbodies. The functionality of the framework is demonstrated by supporting an exemplar nutrient model, applied within the Environmental Virtual Observatory pilot (EVOp) cloud cyber-infrastructure. We demonstrate scope for the use of the framework as a management decision support tool and for further development of integrated biogeochemical modelling.

AB  - Urbanization and agriculture can be considered as main drivers of landscape change in many parts of the world, including France, producing particular interacting environmental gradients, which in combination with natural components, give rise to the urban-rural-natural (URN) gradient. Along this gradient, many complex transitional landscapes, in which dynamic processes and unstable conditions occur, can be identified. This research focused on the development of a broadly applicable methodology to classify and analyze the entire URN gradient, beginning with widely available Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) data. Kernel Density Estimation was used to model LULC density gradients and Principal Component and ISODATA cluster analysis were combined to classify the landscape types composing the URN gradient. A particular adjacency graph analysis supported the visualization, a better understanding of the gradient organization, and the discovery of key landscape sequences in the area under investigation. A subsequent characterization of landscape patterns along these sequences, using a database management system and spatial metrics, produced a deeper comprehension of the structures and organization of the landscape along specific portions of the gradient. The discovery and characterization of all the landscape types nested along the URN gradient is crucial to facilitate more effective land use planning in which transitional landscapes assume a key role.

AB  - Spatial configuration and physical characteristics of landscape features can strongly influence perceptions of fear and danger. This study examined how situational characteristics, particularly spatial enclosure shaped by surrounding vegetation, are related to perception of safety in a park setting. Study stimuli involved eight 360° immersive virtual environments (IVE) representing low, medium, and high spatial enclosure situations based on the degree of visual and locomotive permeability shaped by the physical arrangement of vegetation. Forty-eight students experienced the IVEs wearing a head mounted display device and then indicated on a 5-point scale how safe they would feel walking alone in that location during the day. Immediately after rating each IVE, participants indicated the main reasons they would feel either safe or unsafe in that particular location. Analysis results indicated that subjects perceived high enclosure environments as significantly less safe than medium and low enclosure environments. In addition to enclosure formed by vegetation, attributes that contributed to perception of safety were presence of non-threatening people and paths. Results indicated that gender differences in perceived safety were significant for the high and medium enclosed environments only. Study findings would allow urban planners and park managers to better understand how the spatial characteristics of existing or planned urban greenspace are likely to influence perceived safety and consequently use patterns and the attainment of social and psychological benefits provided by urban parks. Such an understanding can help generate evidence-based guidelines for improving safety while preserving desired aesthetic and ecological properties of the landscape.

AB  - The narrative of “Jakarta is sinking!” has grown louder following the seasonal flood events over the past few years. What makes the case interesting is that the actual shape of land subsidence is growing fastest at around 20 cm per year in the northwest area, which is dominated by housing and settlements rather than commercial buildings and industries. This study aims to provide an academic explanation of the land subsidence phenomenon from the perspective of historical institutionalism. Applying spatial analysis and documentary reviews, we discussed the relationship between policy directions and land subsidence forms over decades. This paper found that spatial policy which have been pushed the urbanization in north Jakarta has contributed a more significant impact on land subsidence. The inability of government policy to address groundwater utilization both from the settlements and industries with the provisioning of access to safe water, emerged as one of the most significant factors triggering land subsidence.

AB  - Conceptualizing landscape as either cultural or natural leads to an hierarchial biotic or biogeographic landscape classification system. This system has three components: urban, agricultural or natural “islands”; each of these can be surrounded by a dominant matrix of one of the others. This simple landscape typology provides a planning framework at various scales of jurisdictional interest. The difficulties of developing landscape management strategies for the urbanizing portion of Southern Ontario, predominantly in agricultural use, are illustrated by examining historical and cultural land-use trends. Selecting from a list of 42 technical principles for environmental management, the specific landscape planning and management strategies applicable to the various landscape scales — Federal, Provincial, Watershed, County, and Urban, and for various types of projects are examined. The question of resource inventory, mapping, and evaluative procedures for cultural-historical resources, and for renewable and non-renewable natural resources is then addressed in the context of policy planning and plan preparation for the Waterloo Regional (County) government. Eight years of advice from the Regional Ecological and Environmental Advisory Committee illustrates the role such advisory committees can play in the land-use planning and evaluation process appropriate to a Regional Municipality government structure, as well as the political difficulties such advisory committees engender. For these two lower governmental levels, appropriate use of base maps of biophysical, (abiotic, biotic) cultural—historic, and agricultural features coupled with the use of environmental assessment and environmental design, can facilitate environmental management intervention at critical junctures. Patterns of urban growth, urban and agricultural water supply, energy conservation, sewage, recycling of solid wastes, agricultural drainage, inappropriate crop uses of agricultural land, degradation of woodlands, renovation of gravel pits and valley-lands, urban rehabilitation, development of environmental data banks, and management/ownership of high-quality natural or sensitive areas require action. Because local governments are more knowledgeable about cultural and regional nuances, direct transfer payments or block grants to local governments might better achieve environmental quality objectives rather than more upper-level planning legislation, or regulation. An expanded role for the private sector in environmental management is outlined.

AB  - The long-term evolution of anthropogenic landscapes has represented over the centuries a process of adaptation of rural communities to the natural constraints that have always conditioned production processes and their development in the Mediterranean basin. Farmers tried to free themselves from these bonds with a series of agricultural works and practices, more or less traditional and linked with on-site environmental characteristics. Land reclamation, and intense work of terracing, retaining walls, and drainage channels are examples of such planning activities. Assuming the permanence of farmers in suboptimal districts, such as mountainous areas, this chapter focuses on the intrinsic relationship between landscape and agriculture and the latent impact on soil degradation, both on-site and off-site, with a specific discussion on the Northern Mediterranean case.

AB  - A rural landscape is the result of the interaction among natural elements and human activities which takes place in time and space. It represents a non-renewable resource that can provide incomparable information on the general state of the environment. The rapid transformations that are taking place in the last century push towards the implementation of monitoring actions able to take into account the various components of the land use, including their concurrent time evolution as well. We performed an analysis of temporal transformations of a rural landscape using an open-source GIS approach that allowed for mainstreaming of the main features of this rural landscape, i.e. land use patterns, naturalness dynamics, landscape diversity and visual quality. These four parameters have been selected since they represent those which most affect the processes at the base of the environmental planning and management of a rural landscape. The survey has been carried out over a period of 138 years, using historical maps, interpretation of aerial photos and implementing digital cartography, that have been retrieved with reference to a study area located in the Basilicata Region (southern Italy), which is considered a territory with an high rural – i.e., both natural and agricultural - landscape value. This methodology has allowed for the examination of the landscape from different points of view, experimenting the performance of a multi-temporal and inter-disciplinary analysis. The main results show – since the landscape has been completely transformed by man in terms of land use – that the areas covered in the past by forest have been transformed into agricultural areas, as opposed to some areas where re-naturalisation processes have taken place. Starting from this first analysis, the implemented methodology, based on a multidisciplinary approach, has enabled to identify the transformations which have greatly influenced the time evolution of the study area. The resulted assessment of land use patterns, landscape diversity, naturalness dynamics and visual quality of this study area, thus enables suitable strategies for the restoration of the local rural ecosystems.

AB  - Offshore wind farms are expanding rapidly as a clean energy solution but raise concerns about light-related environmental impacts, such as shadow flicker and light pollution, affecting ecosystems and human communities. This study assesses the light environmental impacts of offshore wind farms in South Korea, specifically evaluating daytime shadow flicker and nighttime light pollution, and proposes mitigation strategies tailored to diverse landscape contexts. Using advanced geospatial tools, including QGIS and WindPRO, light-related disturbances were analyzed across three representative sites: Aphae (rural), Jangbogo (island), and Dadaepo (urban). Shadow flicker exposure was quantified based on turbine specifications, solar dynamics, and observer locations, while light pollution from aviation obstruction lights was assessed through spatial luminance analysis. The Aphae site exhibited the highest shadow flicker exposure, with up to 154 days annually and 79 h per year in some regions, while Dadaepo's urban zone displayed moderate impacts, particularly in tourist areas like Molundae Observatory. Jangbogo experienced negligible effects due to natural buffering and greater separation distances. Light pollution intensity correlated with proximity and turbine visibility, with 8–13 turbines visible in highly impacted zones. Tailored mitigation strategies, such as optimized turbine placement, green buffers, zoning regulations, and habitat preservation, are essential to minimizing adverse impacts. This research underscores the need for location-sensitive planning to achieve sustainable offshore wind energy development while safeguarding ecological and human well-being.

AB  - Historical data on land cover/use and road networks are important not only for cultural heritage preservation in the context of digital humanities, but also for understanding the evolution of landscapes and human infrastructures aimed at efficient management of land systems. In this manuscript, we present a spatial database that contains basic background layers of the island of Cyprus in the 1960s. These data are derived from the topographic map of Cyprus produced in the 1960s and published in 1969. They were acquired after the digitization of the K715 map series (1:50,000) of the Corps of Engineers of the U.S. Army Map Service (hereafter "K715 map") [1]. The database consists of the following vector layers: a) land use/land cover, b) road network, c) coastline, d) settlements, and covers the entire area of the island (9,251 km2). The road network is divided into six categories and the land use/land cover into thirty-three different types according to the legend of the original map. In addition, the 1960 census was included in the database to assign population data to settlement entities (towns or villages). This census was the last census of the total population under the same authority and method, since Cyprus was divided into two parts five years after the map was published and as a result of the Turkish invasion. Therefore, the dataset can be used not only for cultural and historical preservation purposes, but also to measure the different development of the landscapes that fell under a different political status since 1974.

AB  - Evaluation of achievement of set targets is a necessary step in landscape planning in order to learn from the past, reassess implemented measures and enhance trust in public managers and institutions. Though it is commonly accepted that indicators play a major role in such evaluations, so far no accepted framework for evaluating planning outcomes exists. Furthermore, the selection of appropriate indicators and reference values to effectively assess conditions of landscapes and determine whether observed developments can be considered positive or negative remains challenging. Our study contributes to much-needed research on this topic with a proposed evaluation framework built on goals, indicators and reference values. We analyzed the landscape section of eight Swiss cantonal comprehensive plans to specifically address (1) whether currently tracked indicators suffice to evaluate landscape-planning goals; (2) what a minimal set of landscape indicators for regional planning might look like; and (3) how the ratified value approach could be operationalized to develop reference values for landscape indicators. All eight plans have a similar hierarchical goal system with six major landscape goals, up to 18 themes and 21–33 subordinate goals. The studied cantons track from 29 to 84 indicators. We found a considerable imbalance in the ratio between subordinate goals and indicators, with comparatively few indicators being tracked to assess visual and recreational landscape quality. Our proposed minimal indicator set is well balanced since it lists 5–7 indicators for each theme. The general procedure for modeling reference values is based on the assumption that the protection status of a landscape is a proxy for high societal appreciation of a place. Consequently, indicator values for these areas would reflect reference values (ratified values). We illustrate the procedure with the exemplary indicator impervious surface. The proposed indicators and maps are powerful tools for outcome evaluation and also facilitate benchmarking, i.e. interregional comparisons of landscape qualities, which could be very useful for landscape planning in Europe.

AB  - The Campagna Romana, a landscape of unrivalled historical and cultural importance, can be subdivided into three main sectors, characterised by different plant communities, climate, geology and impact of man; these are the west sector, the river Tiber and the east sector. This landscape typology is a striking example of man-environment interaction: its primary source is in different climatic and geological conditions of these three sectors , but it was strongly reinforced by different land use. The western sector has been conserved in a semi-natural state until recent times while the eastern sector, characterised by communities influenced by man and ruins, has been almost completely devoid of woody vegetation probably since the Roman Empire.

AB  - The new landscape typology of Belgium fits into the European Landscape Convention to characterise contemporary landscapes in a trans-regional and trans-border perspective. The method uses a combination of holistic and parametric approaches at two scale levels, resulting in two different landscape typologies. Four datasets covering Belgium were used: a DTM, CORINE Land Cover, a soil map, and a satellite image. Eighteen variables were defined, describing the landscape characteristics of square kilometre cells at the first scale level. These variables are used to assign a landscape type to each cell. At the second scale level, the spatial patterns formed by the grid landscape types are delineated into landscape units and described using landscape metrics. The types and patterns composition properties of the units are used in a cluster analysis to define landscape types at the second scale level. The method creates an open landscape GISdatabase enhancing the landscapes characterisation at both scale levels. The variables used to differentiate landscape types and character areas can be extended by additional descriptive variables of very different sources relating for example to regional classifications, cultural, historical, scenic properties and even iconographic documents. Thus the landscape character map is the entry to various queries.

AB  - In contested wind farm developments, the dominant issue concerns scenic impact and the landscape at the proposed site. The number of large wind power schemes that have failed is growing. The case analysed here is a near-shore wind farm in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea, in 2001 the largest wind project (278MW) ever proposed in the Netherlands. The government refused to negotiate with civil society organizations representing various landscape values, primarily with the WaddenVereniging and its allies. The often suggested idea that siting wind farms offshore could solve the problems encountered onshore is naïve and far too simple. Siting issues offshore are just as relevant as onshore, as this case study illustrates. As most current offshore developments, the case concerns a near-shore development. It would have been highly visible in an iconic landscape. In such cases, the main dialogue is similar to onshore schemes, which is about impact on the landscape, or ‘seascape’, as perceived by the public. The paper provides description of the historical development of the area, highlighting significant scenic and ecological values, as well as cultural heritage and its importance for tourism and the rural economy. The acceptability and the assessment of different qualities in relation to wind farm siting are analysed with a survey among members of the WaddenVereniging, the national environmental organization for the protection of the Wadden region. The analysis reveals that these environmentalists with their strong identification with the landscape, believe that there are suitable sites for wind turbines in this sensitive area. However, the spatial layout that was chosen by the developers was based on a landscape assessment of the governmental architect. This was a highly technocratic, top-down decision that did not take account of the landscape preferences of the public. This decision evoked its opposition, and eventually, the WaddenVereniging succeeded in generating sufficient national political support to scupper this project.

AB  - Purpose
This paper aims to assess the factors favoring the adoption of the challenges faced and support mechanism, which will lead to the proliferation of glass fiber-reinforced gypsum (GFRG) technology in India.
Design/methodology/approach
Semi-structured interviews with 35 experts, including construction developers, architects, contractors, government officials and design consultants, were conducted. This qualitative data was analyzed using thematic analysis and matrix analysis.
Findings
GFRG-based buildings produce much less carbon footprints as compared to traditional ones and can be safely recommended as a promising, environmentally sensitive technology of the future. The major drivers in its adoption are its efficient construction capability, energy and soil conservation and significant waste reduction. Some of the challenges in implementation are long planning time, lack of skilled labor, lack of awareness about green building technologies and myopic perception of high cost incurred in green building adoption in people’s minds.
Practical implications
This study establishes that the construction industry has the potential to contribute toward creating a sustainable and green planet. It does so by evaluating and then positively positioning GFRG as an environmentally friendly building system.
Originality/value
The harmful effects of continuous environmental manipulation by humans leading to its degradation is a critical discussion agenda for most nations of the world. The issue has been taken up seriously by developing countries, and now, developing countries are also becoming sensitised to it. Several policies toward the attainment of this goal have been formulated and are being implemented by government and private bodies. Although some authors have studied the issues and challenges related to the adoption of green buildings, their attempts mostly focused on developed countries. Moreover, research that investigated the evaluation of the GFRG building system as a successful green technology of the future is inadequate.

AB  - Ecotourism can contribute to the conservation of environmental values, as well as to the development of positive synergies between agents in the tourism sector, tourists and the local population. The growing interest in tourism offers with low environmental impact, which support the local economy, translates into a competitive advantage for low‐density territories. On the basis of this principle, the scope of the present study is intended to evaluate the potential of the existing natural and rural features in the Beira Baixa region, located in the central interior of Portugal, which can anchor the creation of sustainable tourism products. Despite the undeniable interest in carrying out studies to determine an aggregate suitability index for the development of ecotourism using spatial multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), there are still no studies carried out in Portugal. The identification of areas suitable for the development of ecotourism, and their constraints, was carried out on the basis of the integration of nine criteria using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in a geographical information system (GIS) environment. The results obtained reveal that the region has high suitability for the practice of ecotourism activities, given its important natural heritage. This study was innovative as it shows the ecotourism potential based on a diversity of criteria as an aid to public administration agents with functions in planning, territorial management and management of support mechanisms for the tourist sector. The use of the landscape diversity criteria, which had not yet been tested in previous studies, proved to be important in determining the ecotourism potential of the region, together with the landscape value based in the importance of the Montado agrosystem, which supports a variety of sustainable tourist activities. The information produced in the study may be useful for the design of new policies for valuing natural resources through tourism.

AB  - Agrarian landscapes theoretically provide ecosystem services that meet the demands of a wide range of socioecological processes. Consequently, any landscape agroecology approach must tackle the dynamic interaction of land-use distribution and associated social metabolism at different spatiotemporal scales. An agroecological scarcity case study explores how driven agricultural energy flows interact with landscape complexity in arid landscapes of 46 counties in the Qazvin Province (Iran). An Energy-Landscape Integrated Analysis (ELIA) was performed to correlate the energy reinvestment (E) and energy redistribution (I) present within the social metabolism network, with landscape complexity (Le) measured in terms of spatial patterns and related ecological processes. As well, a cluster analysis was run to establish agrarian landscape typologies based on the ELIA indicators. The results of this study provide an explicit sketch of the four strategies that society in Qazvin Province has developed within the dry environments that sustain it. Our findings confirm the hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between optimizing non-dissipative internal energy loops and landscape complexity, which can explain agroecosystem sustainability. This research enables us to define spatially informed agroecological transitions from a territorially explicit socioecological perspective and will make a significant contribution to decisions on agricultural policies given different land-use strategies, especially under scenarios of ecological scarcity.

AB  - Europe's cultural landscape has undergone notable changes in the last few decades. In particular, conserving the cultural rural landscape of the Mediterranean basin constitutes a difficult task due to the fact that, on one hand, rural abandonment, and on the other, agricultural intensification, are generating a new type of landscape which is apparently less appealing than the traditional one. Indeed, this landscape depends upon the maintenance of traditional agricultural uses and their associated activities, both of which depend on local environmental conditions and on socio-economic conditioning factors. The latter are increasingly being seen as the causes of the changes. Modifications in the social structure and processes affect and alter the rural environment, so that ecological and socio-economic information must be integrated for use as a basis for land use planning and management. In the present paper we have applied numerical analyses which associate territorial structure with economic and socio-cultural structure, predicting new types of landscape by means of experimental scenarios of socio-economic changes. The configuration of the traditional rural landscape studied and its spatial heterogeneity depend upon the proportion of the agriculture, pasture and woodland components of the traditional systems. Formalization of this landscape–socio-economy dependence enables us to consider scenarios of socio-economic change and to deduce variations in the landscape. We simulated changes related to the promotion or abandonment of agriculture. The model developed can be considered as an effective agri-environmental indicator, as it provides most of the characteristics required for analysis and environmental appraisal at landscape level.

AB  - We have developed a new hierarchical European Landscape Classification that can be used as a framework for, e.g., indicator reporting and environmental sampling. Landscapes are ecological meaningful units where many processes and components interact. And as such, landscapes themselves have resulted from long-term interactions of natural abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic processes. A good understanding of landscapes is essential for its assessment, protection, management and planning. An internationally consistent approach is therefore obligatory and the production of landscape classifications and associated maps is an important tool in this context. Although intuitive maps are available there are no consistent quantitative maps of European landscapes. In this paper, landscapes are regarded as forming recognizable parts of the earth's surface and as showing a characteristic ordering of elements. The complex nature of the underlying scientific concepts, which sometimes overlap and conflict, requires an objective and consistent methodology, as described in the present paper. As there are many regional differences in landscape properties, it is crucial to strike the right balance between reducing the inherent complexity and maintaining an adequate level of detail. Against this background, a European Landscape Map (LANMAP) has been produced, making use of available segmentation and classification techniques on high-resolution spatial data sets. LANMAP is a landscape classification of Pan-Europe with four hierarchical levels; using digital data on climate, altitude, parent material and land use as determinant factors; and has 350 landscape types at the most detailed level. At this level there are 14,000 mapping units with a minimum mapping unit of 11km2. Thus far, LANMAP is limited to a biophysical approach, since there is a lack of consistent and European-wide data on cultural–historical factors. This paper describes the conceptual background of LANMAP, its methodology and results, and shows its potentials and limitations.

AB  - Landscape ecologists and planners are dealing with a largely similar area of interest. Scientists studying landscapes offer new insights about the processes acting in different spatial structures and scales. This understanding can be useful for planners who are principally involved in optimization of the use of space or the improvement of the environmental conditions. The basic key for a successful application of the scientific knowledge is good communication and reciprocity in understanding. The goals of landscape researchers and planners are different and so are many of their concepts and theories. Also, the time limits, the means and possibilities for realizing their objectives might be very different and follow different rules. A successful implementation of landscape ecology in practical applications of environmental and spatial planning demands careful thought how landscape ecological concepts and thoughts can be translated and communicated to people who have to consider much more aspects than just the one dealing with the landscape. Key concepts, theories and methods from landscape ecology and environmental and spatial planning are compared and evaluated. Possible connections and misunderstanding are discussed and suggestions are made to improve the interaction and to extend the interdisciplinary approach in landscape research.

AB  - Agriculture impacts the ecological status of freshwaters through multiple pressures such as diffuse pollution, water abstraction, and hydromorphological alteration, strongly impairing riverine biodiversity. The agricultural effects, however, likely differ between agricultural types and practices. In Europe, agricultural types show distinct spatial patterns related to intensity, biophysical conditions, and socioeconomic history, which have been operationalised by various landscape typologies. Our study aimed at analysing whether incorporating agricultural intensity enhances the correlation between agricultural land use and the ecological status. For this, we aggregated the continent's agricultural activities into 20 Areas of Farming-induced Freshwater Pressures (AFFP), specifying individual pressure profiles regarding nutrient enrichment, pesticides, water abstraction, and agricultural land use in the riparian zone to establish an agricultural intensity index and related this intensity index to the river ecological status. Using the agricultural intensity index, nearly doubled the correlative strength between agriculture and the ecological status of rivers as compared to the share of agriculture in the sub-catchment (based on the analysis of more than 50,000 sub-catchment units). Strongest agricultural pressures were found for high intensity cropland in the Mediterranean and Temperate regions, while extensive grassland, fallow farmland and livestock farming in the Northern and Highland regions, as well as low intensity mosaic farming, featured lowest pressures. The results provide advice for pan-European management of freshwater ecosystems and highlight the urgent need for more sustainable agriculture. Consequently, they can also be used as a basis for European Union-wide and global policies to halt biodiversity decline, such as the post-2027 renewal of the Common Agricultural Policy.

AB  - Many cities are under intense heat challenges with severe environmental, social, and economic consequences, sparking great concern on heat-resilient urban planning, yet normally with biased focus on limited (e.g., diurnal) mitigation needs. Particularly, the recognition of urban thermal hotspots is crucial for adding effective cooling interventions for mitigation and avoiding overheating in newly built areas. However, the hotspots and associated drivers vary across time and space, bringing challenges to urban planners to make win-win decisions to synchronously address diurnal and nocturnal heat stresses through an integrated set of cooling strategies. This study aims to recognize the homogeneity and heterogeneity of diurnal and nocturnal hotspots and interpret principal and synergetic drivers behind them by developing a robust methodological scheme in addressing uncertainties associated with temperature data and analytical models. It explicitly 1) identified summer diurnal and nocturnal hotspots using rigorously screened satellite data; 2) recognized the typical typologies of hotspot-prone urban landscape according to urban composition, morphology, and function; 3) explored the day-night similarities and disparities in major urban factors and their robust effective ranges for synergetic mitigation through multi-model non-linear analysis with diverse machine learning techniques covering random forest, gradient boosting machines, and boosted regression trees. Results revealed that the specific locations and typical urban landscape features varied between diurnal and nocturnal hotspots. Among the six typologies recognized, industrial-dominated ones were more inclined to emerge as diurnal hotspots, while mid- to high-rise and mid-density blocks, with diversified land uses (mostly residential-dominated), tended to become diurnal, and more likely, nocturnal hotspots. All three models reached robust conclusion that urban morphology exhibited significant influence on both diurnal and nocturnal hotspot formation. Although trade-offs remained unavoidable in many cases, synergetic mitigation could be achieved through optimizing area averaged building height below 15 m or above 25 m, and building volume density under 2 % for Wuhan, China. Overall, this study responds to the emerging multidimensional urban science and praxis and extends the conventional one-dimensional planning against urban heat to win-win decisions over both diurnal and nocturnal hotspots. The empirical findings can benefit the development of complete, unbiased, and implementable actions for enhanced climate-resilience.

AB  - Geomorphology is fundamental to landscape analysis, as it represents the main parameter that determines the land spatial configuration and facilitates reliefs classification. The goal of this article is the elaboration of thematic maps that enable the determination of different landscape units and elaboration of quality and vulnerability synthetic maps for landscape fragility assessment prior to planning human activities. For two natural spaces, the final synthetic maps were created with direct (visual-perceptual features) and indirect (cartographic models and 3D simulations) methods from thematic maps with GIS technique. This enabled the creation of intrinsic and extrinsic landscape quality maps showing sectors needing most preservation, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic landscape fragility maps (environment response capacity or vulnerability towards human actions). The resulting map shows absorption capacity for areas of maximum and/or minimum human intervention. Sectors of high absorption capacity (minimum need for preservation) are found where the incidence of human intervention is minimum: escarpment bottoms, fitted rivers, sinuous high lands with thick vegetation coverage and valley interiors, or those areas with high landscape quality, low fragility and high absorption capacity, whose average values are found across lower hillsides of some valleys, and sectors with low absorption capacity (areas needing most preservation) found mainly in the inner parts of natural spaces: peaks and upper hillsides, synclines flanks and scattered areas. For the integral analysis of landscape, a mapping methodology has been set. It comprises a valid criterion for rational and sustainable planning, management and protection of natural spaces.

AB  - Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC) is a pervasive driver of today's global socioecological crisis. In light of the LUCC in many agricultural landscapes worldwide, natural resource conservation is critical. Put-aside dry agricultural landscapes have significant limitations when attempting to guarantee long-term food production and other ecosystem services in ecological scarcity conditions under climate change scenarios. In this research, an Intermediate Disturbance-Complexity (IDC) model was applied to evaluate how ecological scarcity in NW Iran can be affected by anthropogenic disturbance and landscape complexity. This model calculates both the behaviour of the Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production (HANPP), a proxy of the amount of anthropic disturbance, and a Landscape Ecology (Le) metric, which measures complexity as a heterogeneous and well-connected land matrix. HANPP results show how dry pastures are affected by human pressure, while the results for Le indicate how human activities are affecting ecological corridors linking the northern and the southern parts of the study area. Finally, IDC results show that intermediate disturbance can have a positive effect on the provision of human needs and, at the same time, can help maintain the landscape's ecological functionality. The analysis confirms that land use policies should consider the landscape as a whole and should avoid applying a string of ad hoc decisions to minor pieces of the territory. Our findings support the view that a strong relationship between intermediate disturbance and landscape complexity exists, which highlights the importance of traditional economic activities as ways of maintaining biocultural landscapes.

AB  - Seeking to contribute to a theoretical and analytical approach to the study of landscape, this essay offers directions for integrated future research that combine quantitative with qualitative methodologies towards the ultimate goal of landscape planning and policy implementation. Towards this goal, this paper represents an attempt to apply concerns about landscape theory and appropriate methodology on landscape form, function and meaning by delineating a framework of analysis for the Aegean landscape of Greece. Such a challenging goal, however, undertaken here through critical geographical perspectives, should rather be approached on a transdisciplinary basis. The plethora of processes of action and interaction among the various components of a landscape dictate that there are almost no methodological frameworks and tools that are irrelevant to in landscape study, planning, use or policy implementation. If one focuses on characteristics distinctive to the landscape context, however, such as the visual–cognitive–experiential interface and biophysical–human interaction in the landscape, the beginnings of a theory of landscape as a stage set for human life may, thus, be established. On this basis, a conceptual framework for contemporary multifunctional landscapes is first proposed to serve as a basis for the development of an analytical framework. The case study that follows focuses on the construction of the Aegean cultural landscape, aiming to illustrate and begin to apply concerns and approaches presented in the theoretical part of this study. Aegeanity is first negotiated in theoretical terms on the basis of its distinctive geography, scale and cultural meaning, encompassing landscape characteristics and relationships as presented above. As concerns Aegean landscape analysis, goals and criteria of assessment are interwoven into appropriate methodological schemata and examples of this work presented accordingly.

AB  - Blue-green infrastructure (BGI) is an urban planning approach to hydrological issues that recognises the benefits of using urban green space and naturalised water flows. This process falls under the umbrella of “nature-based solutions” (NBS), i.e., the intentional inclusion of natural system processes within the urban fabric to achieve a range of benefits, including ecosystem services, climate adaptation and mitigation. The planning, design and management of BGI is complex, with multidimensional factors and interactions spanning various fields and disciplines. This complexity can present an obstacle to the adoption, implementation and mainstreaming of the approach. One of the emerging issues and challenges is to understand how diverse stakeholders respond to BGI and how decision makers can comprehend and use such responses. A tool supported by a body of theoretical knowledge is proposed to facilitate the research and investigation of unknown fields. Based on an integrative literature review, this paper formulates an attitudinal analytical framework (AAF) for understanding the human-BGI relationship. The established AAF synthesises, into a framework, multidimensional perspectives and integrates subject-, object- and context-related factors that can influence people's attitudes towards BGI. The proposed AAF bridges disciplinary boundaries, embracing the potential symbiosis among humans, BGI and place. This paper contributes to BGI adoption by forming the basis for further inter- and transdisciplinary research and practices of BGI. Its significance lies in establishing a theoretical framework to better our understanding of the human-BGI relationship, which is a prerequisite to the successful implementation of effective BGI, thereby promoting climate-resilient cities.

AB  - Urban habitat gardens, designed at the urban community scale, are increasingly recognized as vital components of urban green infrastructure, contributing to biodiversity conservation and enhancing urban resident well-being. Despite their growing implementation, comprehensive studies examining their delivery of cultural ecosystem services (CESs) in densely populated areas remain limited. Previous research has predominantly focused on ecological impacts while largely neglecting the social dimensions influencing CES perception and valuation. This study bridges this gap by conceptualizing the multiscale feedback framework linking cultural ecosystem services and urban socio-ecological drivers. Using a mixed-methods approach, we then testified the conceptual framework by a case study focusing on eight habitat gardens in Changning District, Shanghai city of China. Results indicate that recreational and aesthetic values were most highly rated, while inspiration received the lowest valuation. Approximately 30% of residents reported disservices including animal disturbances, safety concerns, and health issues. Both social factors (age, education, gender, employment), usage patterns (visit frequency, duration), and ecological characteristics (plant diversity, landscape connectivity) significantly influenced CES perceptions. The findings underscore the necessity of integrating ecological properties with community characteristics to optimize habitat gardens’ efficacy in biodiversity conservation and CES delivery. We recommend holistic strategies that balance ecological and social sustainability in urban planning.

AB  - The residential landscape constitutes a significant portion of the urban environment. With the increasing mobility of our society, many people come to reside in environments with unfamiliar plant communities and environmental conditions. In this research, 232 Phoenix, Arizona homeowners were surveyed to investigate their residential landscape preferences and to what degree these preferences were reflected in their actual behaviors in their front and backyards. Landscape preferences vary between the front and backyard residential landscapes in a manner consistent with [Goffman, E., 1959. The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Anchor Books, New York] about the symbolic presentation of self. When a multinomial logistic regression model was constructed to predict front yard landscape preference with the independent variables income, length of residence in the Phoenix area, degree of environmental concern and engagement in desert recreational activities, income was the only significant predictor. In the front yard, lower-income homeowners tend to prefer lawn, middle-income homeowners preferred desert landscaping and higher-income homeowners’ preferences were divided between desert and oasis landscape. While backyard landscape preferences varied among income groups, income was not a significant predictor of backyard landscape preference. Landscape preferences for the front and backyard were significantly different and 55% of respondents preferred different landscape typologies for the front and backyards. Overall, for landscape preference in the front yard, form follows class-specific fashion. For landscape preference in the backyard, form is more likely to follow individual fantasy. Landscape preferences were then compared with landscape behaviors. One-third of respondents expressed landscape preferences that were different from their landscape behaviors. However, the development industry has a significant influence on the design and construction of residential neighborhoods in Phoenix [Kirby, A., 2000. All new, improved! Cities 17(1), 1–5]. In an effort to sell homes, developers’ anticipate homeowners’ tastes and package their homes with desirable front yard ‘dreamscapes’ [Jencks, C., 1993. Heteropolis: Los Angeles, the Riots and the Strange Beauty of Hetero-Architecture, Academ Editions, London]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the macro-level influence of the developer's landscape legacy would have a greater impact on the front yard's appearance (behavior) than on the backyard's appearance. For the front yard, both the legacy and the homeowner's preference were significant predictors of landscape behavior, but in the backyard, only the homeowner's preference had a significant influence. The manifestations of the residential landscape reflect expressions of self, status, and conceptions of place that combine to create little understood ‘dreamscapes’. We must recognize the importance of the front yard as a visible symbol of self, the backyard's role as a personal pleasure ground, and the conflict that may occur when the natural landscape is relatively inhospitable to domestic behaviors.

AB  - European Greenway developments typically ‘upcycle’ disused transport corridors for multi-use, non-motorised public infrastructure. The linear and relatively undisturbed nature of these disused infrastructures means many currently function as high quality ecological corridors. Corridors providing connectivity among habitat patches can mitigate the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity, allowing species dispersal throughout the landscape matrix. The sustainable integration of Greenway infrastructure and ecological corridor functions requires consideration during design, development and maintenance stages, taking into account surrounding landscape composition and connectivity. This paper presents a method to characterise a proposed Greenway corridor landscape, focusing on habitat composition and ecosystems connectivity. Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) was used to comprehensively describe the structural connectivity of linear and spatial habitats occurring within the study area. A subsequent multivariate classification of structural connectivity and habitat data determined six distinctive landscape characters. Interpretation of these landscape characters highlights the principal habitat compositions and connectivity conditions in terms of habitat core, links and potential linkages. For example one landscape was intensified, yet retained high woodland connectivity, while another diverse habitat landscape supported little connectivity for woodland and grasslands. The results of this study suggest significant opportunities exist to enhance European landscape connectivity through informed Greenway development. Crucial habitat linkages can be optimised along Greenway infrastructure, contributing towards the realisation of European Greenways as Green Infrastructure and true sustainable projects.

AB  - Urban heat islands and frequent heatwave exacerbate the risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality. This study demonstrates the significant and previously underestimated influence of the adjacency effect in high-resolution studies of the urban thermal environment. The contribution of three-dimensional (3D) geometry of target and adjacent landscapes on thermal environment were simulated by leveraging the urban thermal radiative transfer (UCM-RT) model. Typical two-dimensional and 3D metrics were calculated to examine the relationships between characteristics of urban landscapes and land surface temperature (LST). Our results demonstrate a threefold stronger thermal impact from adjacent 3D urban landscapes compared to internal landscapes (maximum thermal effects: 3.8 K vs. 0.7 K), emphasizing their crucial role in shaping thermal patterns. The bivariate correlation analysis has also revealed that the correlation between neighboring 3D landscape metrics and urban LST is higher by 0.09 than that of the inside landscape. A strong positive relationship exists between the 3D landscape metrics with urban LST. The results highlight the significance of adjacent thermal effects in refined urban thermal environment studies. These findings support the in-depth exploration of urban thermal processes to minimize the potential health impacts of thermal risk.

AB  - The application of ecological concepts to the industrial setting has been touched upon by literature across several disciplines. Two emerging ecological planning approaches, landscape ecology and industrial ecology, are applied here to look at alternative ways of planning industrial parks. As an emerging field, landscape ecology provides different viewpoints from the traditional approach of natural conservation, which mainly focuses on the protection of nature. The approach of landscape ecology regards the environment as a land mosaic, a mixture of natural and urban environment, which concerns a manageable human-scale environment across one or two human generations. Industrial ecology, on the other hand, goes beyond the traditional “end of pipe” idea of pollution control and learns from the ecosystem concept. The current paper is an attempt to reconcile these two fields as an integrated approach to the planning of industrial areas. Using a case study of Singapore’s Jurong Island industrial park, two fundamental issues behind the idea of landscape ecology and industrial ecology are raised. If raw materials, energy and by-products are more easily replaced or reused by technology and management, then research on industrial ecology and related knowledge will be crucial for developing natural resource substitution by innovative technology and new ways of environmental management. Where it is difficult to substitute natural resources, the skills of planning and managing natural resources will take priority over other strategies. In this situation, the knowledge of landscape ecology needs to be applied to the prediction, design and evaluation of ecologically optimum resource uses, patterns and processes in the mixture of natural, urban and industrial environment. A new concept, “nurtured landscape”, is proposed for mediating between the natural ecosystem and the urban/industrial environment. The nurtured landscape provides a basis for the development of new ecological technology using landscape to ameliorate the polluting effects of the urban/industrial neighbourhood. The planning of Singapore’s Jurong Island industrial park provides a test of applying the principles of landscape ecology and industrial ecology to the possible transformation of an industrial area.

AB  - In China, 55 ethnic minority groups, accounting for 8.49% of the total population, live on 64.2% of the total land area. In the context of globalization and modernization, these areas retain a wealth of natural and cultural landscape types. Few studies have been conducted on landscape character on a regional scale in China, and to the best of our knowledge, none in multi-ethnic areas. Our study site was Wuling Mountain, which is located in southwest China and populated by multi-ethnic communities. Nine minorities including the Dong, Gelao, Miao, and Tujia have lived in the area for generations, coexisting with Han Chinese. We analyzed trans-regional data to visualize and identify the landscape character types of Wuling Mountain at two levels. The types were characterized at a resolution of 1km2 based on elevation, relief amplitude, land cover, and ethnic population density. The latter, as a special cultural variable of a multi-ethnic area, indirectly reflects the regional differences in the lives and livelihood activities of different ethnic groups. We used the affinity propagation (AP) algorithm based on a bottom-up approach of a combination of the geographic information system (GIS). The results highlighted the inhabited landscape characteristics of different combinations of minority ethnic populations and the key landscape characteristics that could be used as a basis for the development of trans-regional protection, management, and planning of the natural and cultural landscape in this multi-ethnic area.

AB  - Today's agricultural landscapes are becoming decors, as the old pattern of conditions for regionally differentiated farming systems is disappearing. The variety of regionally differentiated landscapes is unlikely to increase. Some types of landscape will disappear, others will be sufficiently flexible to survive. In some other areas restoration of the traditional landscape is being considered for reasons like tourism, ecology or scenic value. The landscape typology as described here is meant to be a step in setting up a commonly adopted vocabulary and this we need in order to know what we are talking about. The interaction between agricultural land use and the long-term management of the landscape is discussed at length. The main conclusion is that the variation in agricultural landscapes in Europe will probably diminish if the world market for agricultural products has its way and landscape planning is ignored.

AB  - Current research on sustainability of cities has favoured the implementation and conservation of greenery in the urban context. The benefits of plants are not just environmental but recreational, aesthetic and emotional. The full benefits of plants and the role they play in the ecology of cities remain to be mapped out but the general significance of plants appears to be uncontested. This paper proposes a new architectural and planning metric for greenery in cities and buildings. This new metric, the green plot ratio (GPR), is based on a common biological parameter called the leaf area index (LAI), which is defined as the single-side leaf area per unit ground area. The green plot ratio is simply the average LAI of the greenery on site and is presented as a ratio that is similar to the building plot ratio (BPR) currently in use in many cities to control maximum allowable built-up floor area in a building development. GPR allows more precise regulation of greenery on site without excluding a corresponding portion of the site from building development. It provides flexibility to the designer while simultaneously protecting the green quota in the design. This concept has been applied in a number of design competitions in which the author has collaborated with colleagues and various architectural practices. It has also been adopted as a planning requirement by the client authority for one of the competitions for which the author has entered. While seen as a fundamental and important metric, GPR is not in itself an indicator for all the ecological relationships between plants and cities. A larger set of related metrics need to be developed.

AB  - Forests and environmental areas remain important sources of rural livelihoods in many parts of the world. As economies industrialise and forest is lost, households typically transition towards increasingly commercial livelihoods. Consequently, the relative importance of forests and environmental products tends to decrease. This paper compares rural and environmental incomes on both sides of the national border in northern Laos and Vietnam to better understand changes in environmental resource use as livelihoods commercialise. Based on household survey data (n = 320), I analyse income inequalities and environmental resource uses and quantify the determinants of rural and environmental incomes using linear regression analysis. The study finds that total household incomes are comparable between countries. Although income compositions and asset endowments diverge strongly, land size, value of assets, livestock units, and access to wage and business income positively affect rural household incomes. Environmental income, mainly from subsistence use of non-timber forest products, constitutes an average of 14.9 % of household income in Laos and 1.8 % in Vietnam. Lower-income, asset-poor and subsistence-oriented farmers rely more on environmental income but do not extract higher values from environmental resources. Additionally, ethnic minority households in Vietnam and households residing in the less accessible highland area in Laos have higher relative environmental incomes. The paper provides the first detailed analysis of environmental incomes in Laos and demonstrates the continuing importance of subsistence-based incomes in a mountainous context in Vietnam. Careful attention to regional commodity chains and national environmental policies is needed to appreciate changes in environmental incomes as rural livelihoods commercialise.

AB  - Rural landscapes around the world, including those in New England, face intense development pressures from nearby urban areas. Sustaining rural landscapes requires protecting these lands from development and continuing traditional land stewardship by local residents. Government officials and planners need to understand the attitudes and perceptions of rural residents as the first step in planning for sustainability. This paper describes two studies in rural Massachusetts that explored the hypothesis that place attachment may be an important motivation affecting residents’ attitudes toward land preservation. The first study used a photo-preference questionnaire to survey local residents about their attachment to the rural landscape, their perceptions of rural character, and their attitudes toward land protection. The second study used qualitative interviews with residents in the same region to add new insights to the survey results. Both studies found strong support by local residents for preserving rural character in their areas. Moreover, these studies found a positive correlation between local residents’ support for land protection (both in general and on their own land) and their level of attachment for scenes of rural places in their area. This research presents compelling evidence that local residents’ attachment to the rural landscape is a strong motivation for engaging in land stewardship and preservation efforts to sustain rural places and economies.

AB  - Multifaceted approaches covering various environmental dimensions are essential for improving urban residential soundscapes efficiently in compact urban cities. Particularly, visual landscape factors have been considered as influential for soundscapes. Nevertheless, how potential landscape attributes mutually contribute to the improvement of soundscape qualities across different urban environmental contexts has not been comprehensively investigated. The present study demonstrated evidence of mutual efforts of landscape factors for improving residential soundscapes in compact urban areas. From cross-sectional surveys across public residential blocks in Singapore, seven combinations of window views based on five visual landscape components and their intrinsic qualities were identified. Multivariable analyses adjusting for urban neighborhood contexts, demographic confounders, and physical landscape/soundscape covariates were conducted. The results found that urban residents having a natural and/or open view through a window perceived greater soundscape pleasantness compared to their counterparts (i.e., artificial and closed views). In contrast, window views modified by man-made structures of buildings (i.e., human-modified views) negatively affected soundscape pleasantness, regardless of whether these views were slightly or heavily modified. Although the majority of high-density residential estates may face such low-quality window views in real situations, their adverse effects can be supplementally controlled by implementing water-type neighborhood landscapes or waterscapes. The findings of the present study offer valuable insights into prominent landscape attributes and their mutual and multifaceted contributions for urban soundscape improvements in real-life residential scenes, offering practical implications and sustainable design approaches for urban residential planners and managers.

AB  - The peri-urban areas of European metropolises offer a diversity of vegetated spaces – forests, agricultural land, abandoned or preserved natural areas – that receive ecological attention from city dwellers. This attention varies locally depending on the socio-economic characteristics of the population and raises the question of ecological inequalities in accessing different types of landscapes. Once the target of a green belt project that was never carried out, the peri-urban areas of the Paris region have undergone different trajectories according to local biophysical, social and political characteristics. This article shows how these characteristics interconnect and explain the ecological enhancement or abandonment of landscapes in a complex urban region using flora as an indicator. To do so, (1) we build a landscape analysis at different scales, (2) we collect botanical data at 252 sites and analyse it through statistical multivariate analysis, and (3) we correlate the plant communities’ spatial distribution to socio-economic contexts and planning projects. The results show that the socio-political dimension is decisive for understanding how and why vegetated areas are enhanced or abandoned and helps to correlate ecological preservation and socio-economic contexts locally. Flora reflects these dynamics: the type of management of forest or arable lands, as well as a mixed deprivation/luxury effect on flora. Peri-urban vegetated landscapes are a target for local political projects that may lessen environmental inequalities, or conversely and more insidiously, may perpetuate them.

AB  - Planning Support Systems (PSS) for collaborative sketch planning have not become widely used in planning practice. Important reasons are inadequate functionality and usability. In this article we question if following a socio-technical method in PSS development could lead to PSS with better functionality and usability than following a traditional systems engineering method, as is sometimes suggested in literature. The former method involves close cooperation with users, whereas the latter does not. This article describes an empirical study of this question. The article describes the development, application and evaluation of two PSS for sketch planning, one developed by following the traditional systems engineering method and the other by following the socio-technical method. The PSS integrate drawing and sketching with basic geographic information system functionality and use an innovative hardware interface called Maptable. The evaluation results show that the traditionally developed PSS was immediately rejected by planning practitioners due to poor functionality and usability, whereas the PSS developed with a socio-technical approach was much more acceptable. Intense cooperation with users in agreement with the socio-technical method appeared to improve the analysis of planning tasks and user needs, leading to a PSS with a sophisticated and dedicated architecture. This PSS was considered more functional and usable than the traditionally developed PSS. In addition, the socio-technically developed PSS offers some benefits over conventional planning methods. In current state the PSS is suitable for use by professionals, and it is being further developed aiming to make it suitable for supporting collaborative planning with citizens.

AB  - The implementation of a Green Infrastructure (GI) involves several actors and governance scales that need adequate knowledge support. The multifunctionality of GI entails the implementation of a cross-scale approach, which combines assessments conducted at different levels and active stakeholder engagement.
This paper provides a methodology to implement a cross-scale approach to support the deployment of a Regional GI. The methodology was tested in Lombardy Region (north-west of Italy), considering three relevant territorial scales and relative strategic and planning policies. The continental level representing the overall policy-context; the regional level, with its key role for guaranteeing landscape coherence and connectivity and the local level where planning actions are effectively designed and implemented. The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and the EU GI strategy were used as references for the continental level; at the regional level, a proposal of Regional GI was evaluated focusing on two Provinces (Varese and Lecco), three regional parks (Ticino, Adda Nord and Campo dei Fiori). At the local scale, the new development plan of the Municipality of Cassano d'Adda (Milan metropolitan area) was evaluated considering different possible scenarios.
The regional GI was evaluated with respect to the capacity to provide Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES). CES were mapped using the ESTIMAP-recreation model. The model was adapted to the regional and local level with the active engagement of local stakeholders. Additionally, census data were analysed to obtain an overview of the equitable distribution of the CES amongst inhabitants.
Results show that, in 78% of the census blocks of the study area, inhabitants have a high-value recreation resource within 4 km (31% within 4 km and 47% within 300 m). Unmet demand characterises 22% of the census blocks in the study area, clustered in zones with a high population density. The regional GI covers almost completely the two Provinces and the regional parks. In Varese Province: 68% of the territory is included in the regional GI, 82% of the census blocks local demand for recreation opportunities is met, but the population density is higher where the demand is unmet. The Province is characterised by a relatively old population (share of people older than 65 years 23.4%). In Lecco Province, 80% of the territory is included in the regional GI, in 96% of the blocks the local demand is met and the local population is relatively old (share of elderly population 22.12%).
The three regional parks present significant differences, strongly influenced by the territorial context. The Campo dei Fiori Park is almost completely included in the regional GI. The entire local population has nature-based recreation opportunities in their close vicinity. Nevertheless, the population density is very low and citizens are relatively old. The majority of the Parco Adda Nord is included in the regional GI providing recreation opportunities to 90% of the census blocks within the Park boundaries. A total of 70% of Ticino Park is included in the regional GI, where local residents are relatively old (share of elderly population 23.78%) and 90% of local census blocks are close to nature-based opportunities.
At local scale, we explored how the approach can be used to estimate changes in the CES potential provision and how this can be integrated into a site management plan.
This paper demonstrated that the combination of studies in a cross-scale perspective enhances the understanding of GI multifunctionality. It provides a framework to adapt CES mapping models to the local setting with active stakeholders engagement. Moreover, it demonstrates that also highly urbanised areas, such as the Lombardy Region in Italy, can play a role in the deployment of a continental GI and can support biodiversity and nature protection.

AB  - Species distribution models are often used to study the biodiversity of ecosystems. The modelling process uses a number of parameters to predict others, such as the occurrence of determinate species, population size, habitat suitability or biodiversity. It is well known that the heterogeneity of landscapes can lead to changes in species’ abundance and biodiversity. However, landscape metrics depend on maps and spatial scales when it comes to undertaking a GIS analysis. We explored the goodness of fit of several models using the metrics of landscape heterogeneity and altitude as predictors of bird diversity in different landscapes and spatial scales. Two variables were used to describe biodiversity: bird richness and trophic level diversity, both of which were obtained from a breeding bird survey by means of point counts. The relationships between biodiversity and landscape metrics were compared using multiple linear regressions. All of the analyses were repeated for 14 different spatial scales and for cultivated, forest and grassland environments to determine the optimal spatial scale for each landscape typology. Our results revealed that the relationships between species’ richness and landscape heterogeneity using 1:10,000 land cover maps were strongest when working on a spatial scale up to a radius of 125–250m around the sampled point (circa 4.9–19.6ha). Furthermore, the correlation between measures of landscape heterogeneity and bird diversity was greater in grasslands than in cultivated or forested areas. The multi-spatial scale approach is useful for (a) assessing the accuracy of surrogates of bird diversity in different landscapes and (b) optimizing spatial model procedures for biodiversity mapping, mainly over extensive areas.

AB  - Human influence on the environment differs in terms of distribution and intensity, thus producing a gradient of landscape modifications that translates into different landscape structures. Within this variety of landscapes, fringe areas represent complex spaces where dynamic processes and instable conditions can be observed. In this research Kernel Density Estimation, multivariate spatial analysis, landscape pattern analysis, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were combined to model and characterise landscape gradients, and to analyse the structural features of fringe areas. This methodology was applied to a rural area of central Italy, using density indicators associated with urbanisation, agriculture, and natural elements considered to be key components for the identification of landscape gradients. The results highlight not only specific “pillar” landscapes, which are dominated by said components, but also transitional landscapes, where the most relevant forms of interaction between land uses were identified. Characterisation of landscape structures along the gradient illustrated different trends in patch density, shape complexity and landscape diversity, demonstrating greater variability in fringe areas than in pillar landscapes. PCA revealed a partial overlap between the main structural characteristics of the agro-forestry matrix and the medium intensity agricultural landscapes, whereas urban fringes and semi-natural fringes were clearly separated. The discovery of the continuous landscape gradients and an understanding of the gamut of landscape types nested along them is crucial in allowing for more effective land-use planning in which also fringe areas become a relevant part of the process.

AB  - Forest areas and mountainous territories provide crucial ecosystem services, among which cultural-recreational services are of particular relevance in the Alps. In 2018, the mountain area of Northeast Italy was struck by the VAIA windstorm, resulting in extensive damage to trail networks and substantial landscape transformations in valleys. Restoring the storm-affected area while considering forest resilience and public preferences became a critical need. This research is aimed at assessing the landscape scenic preferences of visitors and residents of the area impacted by the storm with reference to alternative intervention strategies for restoring the VAIA-affected forests. The psychophysical approach was applied to understand residents preferences and a survey was conducted in May 2022, involving 713 residents in the Veneto region. Respondents were requested to evaluate the scenic quality of 8 landscape typologies characterized by panoramic and non-panoramic views, forests with and without fallen trees, and meadows cultivated or abandoned. They were also required to associate eight proposed categories of emotions with the landscapes, providing scores accordingly. To analyze the factors affecting landscape scenic quality we estimated two regression models. The first model highlighted that the scenic quality of the landscape is positively correlated with panoramic views, cultivated meadows, and forests, while abandoned areas or trees felled by VAIA have negative correlations. The second model demonstrated the existence of a strong relationship between landscape quality and the emotions evoked, with certain emotions significantly impacting scenic quality perception. The second model explains a higher proportion of the scenic quality scores than the first one (R2 = 0.788 vs R2 = 0.527) meaning that emotions are a better predictor of scenic quality than the physical characteristics of the territory. Our results suggest that, in order to improve the recreational services of the mountain territories, for restoring the VAIA-affected forests it will be necessary to remove the felled trees and at the same time increase the presence of panoramic views by substituting in some areas the forests with cultivated meadows.

AB  - Erosion processes in the watershed and sediment transport cause hydro-morphological changes, eutrophication, and the loss of storage capacity in reservoirs. This study examines the tool for the optimal selection and implementation (TSI) of eco-remediation measures (ERM) in the river basin area to improve water quality and to reduce storage loss in the reservoir in question. The main purpose of this tool is to support decisions and measures taken to correct defined problems and to improve water quality and storage capacity in the watershed while minimising sediment transport. This tool enables the effective and necessary implementation of these measures to the most critical source areas (CSAs). In order to verify its operability, we selected the Ledava reservoir with a transboundary area of 105.25 km2 in NE Slovenia and SE Austria. With the use of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), critical source areas were determined and the effects of eight different scenarios on sediment yield and load transport were simulated. The results showed that CSAs occupy 12% of the watershed and that sediment inflow into the Ledavsko jezero reservoir could be reduced by up to 30%. After determining the CSAs and which measures would be most effective, the implementation plan could be defined. Within this framework, the TSI enabled the selection of effective measures and contributed to the long-term improvement of the ecological status of surface waters required by Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), improving the quality of water bodies of all types to safeguard water ecosystems from harmful consequences.

AB  - An unresolved issue in creating resilient cities is how to obtain sustainability benefits from densification while not eroding the capacity of social-ecological systems to generate wellbeing for urban dwellers. To understand how different relationships between urban form and wellbeing together play out, we analysed geocoded experiential data (1460 experiences from 780 respondents) together with variables of the physical environment. Through statistical and spatial analysis, we operationalised resilience principles to assess what urban environments provide “resilience at eye level” – a diversity of experiences and a level of connectivity between them that limit adverse outcomes. We found 8 typologies of experiential landscapes – distinct compositions of 11 categories of experiences. Our analysis shows that typologies with experiences supportive of wellbeing are diverse and exist in environments that balance residents and workplaces, avoid extreme spatial integration and/or density and have accessible nature. Typologies with many experiences hindering wellbeing fail in one or several of these respects. Our findings suggest that resilience principles can act as a guiding heuristic for urban densification that does not compromise human wellbeing.

AB  - The identification of landscape classes facilitates the implementation of planning strategies. Although landscape patterns are key distinctive features of landscape classes, existing unsupervised clustering techniques for clustering landscapes rely on categorical input data to quantify such patterns and consider only a limited number of pattern metrics. To unlock the great potential of continuous spatial data, such as remote sensing images, for generating landscape typologies, we adapted a novel unsupervised deep learning method (Deep Convolutional Embedded Clustering; DCEC) to generate a landscape typology for Switzerland. DCEC encodes lower-dimensional representations of input images in a hidden layer, which is simultaneously used to divide the images into well-distinguishable clusters. We applied DCEC to image tiles extracted from satellite images as well as ecological, demographic and terrain layers. DCEC successfully distinguished 45 landscape classes in the continuous input data. We conclude that DCEC is a promising new method in landscape and land-system research.

AB  - Current spatial planning tools focus mainly on land use evaluation and not on spatial plan design. Automated generation of spatial design intends to bridge the gap between graphical design and geographical information systems. We propose a new method that generates spatial plans with a high level of detail and realism. A simple set of rules is derived by the modeler from a landscape type that serves as a reference. These rules are implemented by spatial functions with a landscape type specific objective. In a multi-objective optimization algorithm a landscape plan is generated for a specific lot that meets the objectives. The modeler controls the plan generation process through an objective task list which determines the priority of the objectives. Examples show that the landscape generator is capable of generating plausible spatial plans in reasonable computing time. More specifically, they show that the landscape generator performs best with low configurationally structured reference projects and performs less with high configurationally structured reference projects. The manual construction of the objective task list could be further improved by pre-structured objectives dependent on landscape designer’s preference.

AB  - A landscape sensitivity index provides information about the location of the most sensitive forest areas in terms of visual alteration. This information is needed to recognize those areas which require special attention in terms of management policy decisions and in directing landscape management activities and subsidies. The main goal of this study was to develop and test a GIS-based method to enable the production of a sensitivity index map on a regional scale. To accomplish this, sensitivity criteria, a model and calculating techniques were developed for the landscape province of the Kainuu and Kuusamo hill area in Finland. Sensitivity was described using three main criteria: (i) visibility, (ii) the amount of potential users (use pressure) and (iii) the attractiveness of the landscape – which are further defined by several sub-criteria. The calculation method was based on spatial multicriteria evaluation (SMCE), where cartographic modeling and expert knowledge modeling are utilized. The method was demonstrated and tested by a case study, where a visual landscape sensitivity map was produced for one municipality in the selected landscape province. The results were evaluated by forest and environment experts. The evaluation process showed that the sensitivity values estimated by the sensitivity model were quite similar to the values calculated from the expert map and field evaluations.

AB  - In the circumstances of the 21st-century digital and technological turn, and due to the burst of the cosmopolitan way of living, the urban environment has gradually transformed in its appearance and identity. The loss of object singularity in urban context due to continuous variability and functional indeterminacy blurs the boundaries between architectural and urban scale, personal and social experience. Through an interdisciplinary framework, this paper deals with the fluidity phenomenon instrumentalisation through value-based research of renominated architectural practices in creating an authentic methodological research model that connects urban dynamics and architectural design methods, techniques and instruments in shaping a contemporary spatial experience. The resulting methodological model employs an analytic graphic narrative to formulate a strategy integrating fluidity into the process of architectural design. The paper explains how architectural design, as a cultural practice, employs fluidity to incorporate dynamics and needs, strategically enhancing the expression of urban values, requirements, and narratives.

AB  - Affected air movement, artificial heat production, increased solar absorption and suppressed vegetation cause significant temperature differences between urban and suburban/rural regions, forming Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHI). Here, we propose a methodological framework combining daytime and nighttime Landsat 8 data with comprehensive statistical evaluation based on the retrieved information. To quantify SUHI, we selected a pair of daytime and nighttime Landsat 8 scenes, calculated the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index and applied a comprehensive statistical approach to assess differences in SUHI behaviour across Local Climate Zones and between day and night, examining its relationships with albedo, elevation, land surface emissivity and vegetation cover. Open urban typologies were characterised by milder day temperatures, especially over open areas with higher buildings, while compact low-rise areas presented the highest SUHI intensity. Higher buildings presented more intense SUHI at night, with milder temperatures over open and low-rise regions. These results confirm the SUHI dynamics and its strong association with the urban structure and the presence of vegetation. The proposed complex methodological framework can be, with minor adjustments, applied to other regions as well, which can improve the comparability among studies on SUHI and promote our understanding of its causes and possible mitigation measures.

Thirty landscapes are identified on a continental scale. This pan-European landscape typology is based on the integration of landscape formation factors. The basis for a regionally differentiated geography, morphology and scenery of the man-made landscape is provided by land form, soil and climate on the one hand and regional culture, habits and history on the other. This typology can be used as a reference for a discussion about the actual appearance of the landscape. The map of European landscapes is only a reconnaissance and is therefore not intended as a blueprint for action, but rather as a way of looking at landscape heterogeneity, a set of principles to stimulate the discussion of landscape development throughout the continent.

AB  - City edges have been associated with waste and wastelands for centuries. Refuse dumps have frequently been located at the outskirts of the city, and the metaphor of ‘wasteland’ has been used to depict landscapes at the urban fringe. In this paper, the relationship between actual waste dumps and metaphorical wastelands is brought forward to facilitate an analysis of landscape transformations at the city edge and to reveal the neglect of transient landscapes within spatial planning. In the first part of the paper the interactions between dumps and ‘wastelands’ at the city edge are discussed. In the second part, a case study at the edge of Malmö (in southern Sweden) is presented as an illustration of the transformative city edge and in particular the invisibility of this landscape in local planning. Major landscape transformations during the 20th century are examined along with representations of the area within spatial planning. The primary sources of information have been the archives of the local and regional waste management divisions, local planning documents and field studies. The case study illustrates how the present fringe landscape is constantly camouflaged by a green future; it is always about to be transformed, and therefore ignored. Consequently, an everyday landscape, with hazardous waste as well as places of great potential for recreation, has been disregarded for decades. The paper concludes with a discussion emphasising the importance to unveil such utopian representations, and the need to highlight the present day situation at the city edge.

AB  - Connectivity is a key concern in natural resource planning. Many studies have focused on the development of methods, tools and indices for the assessment of both components of connectivity: structural and functional. In particular, approaches based on graph theory principles have been recently proposed and are being increasingly applied to guide landscape connectivity conservation. However, forest planners and managers still need effective and operational methodologies to detect those landscapes where connectivity should be treated as a particularly critical conservation concern. In addition, in the Mediterranean, as in other parts of the world, socioeconomic changes in the last decades have driven the abandonment of many formerly cultivated lands. This poses both a challenge and an opportunity for managers intending to restore ecological connectivity in forested areas. In this context, setting adequate priorities for the reforestation of agricultural lands is of outmost importance. Here we show how a two-stage hierarchical methodology based on network analysis can be used to meet these needs. In particular, we apply a graph metric based on the measurement of habitat availability at the landscape scale (the Integral Index of Connectivity) to two Mediterranean forest districts in Spain with different management objectives and environmental heterogeneity. First, we identify those landscapes where efforts to improve forest connectivity should be concentrated. In a second stage, we prioritize within those landscapes the individual patches of agricultural lands that, being available for a potential reforestation program, would contribute most to uphold connectivity and ecological flows at wide spatial scales. We show how the extent of the agricultural patches is not strictly related to the contribution to connectivity they would provide if reforested, and how the results of such analysis vary with species traits (dispersal capabilities). We discuss the suitability of the proposed approach for forest landscape planning purposes and conclude that it can provide a useful diagnosis and helpful guidelines for the development of efficient reforestation programs that might be applied in a variety of situations for improving the ecological coherence of forest landscapes.

AB  - The use of spontaneous wild vegetation (SWV) in the plans for urban greening in many cities is beginning to be discussed. However, little is known about how it is perceived and valued by citizens. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of SWV on landscape preferences. An online questionnaire was designed and given to a sample of 708 people in Latin America. The results show that they prefer more formal green spaces to those dominated by SWV. Once informed of the benefits that SWV brings to the city, preferences change, with wild vegetation spaces being more appreciated than formal ones. However, this pattern of preferences changes after 30 days. Preferences return to their initial point, with formal green spaces being appreciated again over wild spaces. The analyses show the importance of environmental education in urban greening strategies to communicate clearly, repeatedly and participatively the benefits of using SWV in public green spaces.

AB  - Like ecosystems, landscapes provide benefits that significantly influence human well-being. However, these benefits are often taken for granted and not accounted for in monetary terms. This project explores how local communities use the surrounding landscapes and the frequency and value of using different types of landscapes for various activities. In a participatory mapping questionnaire, inhabitants of 6 research areas in the Lower Silesia region indicated places where they carry out different activities in selected types of landscapes. Using a discrete choice experiment, we then investigated the public’s willingness to pay for increased provision of landscape services related to the landscape’s spiritual, educational, cultural, aesthetic, and recreational value. Respondents perform the highest number of activities in landscape units where they live. The value of forest landscape is highest, and it is also perceived as multifunctional. There is a significant difference between urban, suburban, and rural respondents, especially in valuing travel time to basic facilities and the importance of place of social integration. Results guide directions for future changes in local landscapes as well as considerations for identifying and valuing landscape benefits in different landscape types.

AB  - Comprehensive maps that characterize the variation in agricultural landscapes across Europe are lacking. In this paper we present a new Europe-wide, spatially-explicit typology and inventory of the diversity in composition, spatial structure and management intensity of European agricultural landscapes. Agricultural landscape types were characterized at a 1km2 resolution based on Europe-wide datasets that represent land cover, landscape structure and land management intensity. Two alternative approaches for typology development were used: an expert-based top-down approach, and a bottom-up approach based on automated clustering using Self Organizing Maps (SOMs). Comparison with available national and European landscape typologies showed that our typology deviates from existing biophysical and anthropocentric typologies relevant to agricultural landscapes as result of the inclusion of land management aspects. Concordance occurred between specific European typology classes, while the comparison with national landscape typologies showed a correspondence in agricultural landscape patterns. Our agricultural landscape typology can provide a basis for landscape assessment at a European-scale to help to identify agricultural landscape types prone to change and landscapes that may require policy response.

AB  - Cairo has been undergoing a major transformation that shifts urban areas from the Nile River to the adjacent desert to accommodate the increased population. These new areas introduce landscape characteristics that differ from the historical, cultural, and symbolic image of the agricultural Nile Valley and its Delta. While desert landscapes might be the suitable answer to the city’s physical needs, their social and cultural acceptance could hinder their implementation. In this regard, the research questions the transformation to an ecologically sensitive landscape while considering the socio-cultural dynamics of the city. It further attempts to understand the cultural and symbolic images and meanings of nature among Cairo’s residents and their acceptance of new landscape paradigms. This was achieved through an image-based quantitative survey of Cairo residents. The findings suggest that the potential for adopting desert landscape character in Cairo is relatively positive. However, due care should be given to the rate of change and transformation to the desert landscape character due to the significance of the prior symbolic meanings and attachments to the Nile Valley. Additionally, the research advocates for the role of ‘landscape character’ in bringing ecology and climate change to the forefront of everyday life in Cairo. The study identifies theoretical and practical implications that could be useful to other cities in transition. It also highlights the interrelation between landscape character, aesthetic experience, and the socio-cultural identity of communities in the context of sustainable landscape transformation. This is especially relevant in rapidly urbanising contexts and climatically affected cities. Understanding the dynamics of these interrelations can lead the way for better insights into resilience and sustainable practices in urban settings and underscores the need for further investigation.

AB  - Due to the multidisciplinary nature of landscape research, many different systems and methods for landscape identification and classification exist. This paper provides a systematic review of 54 contemporary landscape characterisation approaches from all over the world, with the aim of identifying major methodological strategies. Multivariate statistical analyses revealed segregation of the approaches according to the landscape concept applied, the degree of observer independence and various other factors involved in the landscape characterisation process. Our review confirmed a major distinction between approaches rooted in the natural sciences and approaches rooted in the arts and the humanities. Three substantially different methodological approaches or strategies were identified: 1) ‘holistic’ landscape character assessment approaches, by which visual perception and socio-cultural aspects of the landscape are emphasised; 2) landscape characterisation methods based on a priori selection of geo-ecological and land-use-related properties of the landscape; and 3) biophysical landscape characterisation approaches which rely strongly on statistical analyses in order to identify gradients of variation in the presence and/or abundance of landscape elements and properties. Assessment of landform and the composition of natural and human landscape elements was a central part of all of the reviewed methods. A trend towards increasing observer-independence over time was identified.
