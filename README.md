## Project Scope

**DesirMED** is a Horizon Europe-funded initiative focused on addressing the unique challenges posed by climate change in the Mediterranean region. This repository highlights the work from **Work Packages (WP) 4.1 and 4.2**, which aim to:

- Identify critical landscape features essential for climate resilience.
- Develop risk profiles integrating environmental, climatic, and socioeconomic data.
- Provide nature-based solutions (NbS) for adaptive governance and ecosystem preservation.

### Key Objectives
- **Preserve and restore ecosystems** by leveraging NbS.
- **Build climate resilience** using innovative analytical tools.
- **Support decision-making** through risk modeling and stakeholder engagement.

---

### Focus of This Repository
This repository supports the development and open source sharing of codes and analytical information useful to complete both tasks **Work Package 4 (System Knowledge, Data & Design)**, particularly:

1. **Task 4.1**: Identifying Key Landscape Features
   - Characterizing Mediterranean landscapes in terms of climate resilience, resources, and ecosystem services.
   - Mapping landscape interconnections to understand shared resources and services.

2. **Task 4.2**: Developing Regional Risk Profiles
   - Synthesizing climate-related risks across Demonstrating and Replicating Regions.
   - Creating risk profile metrics that integrate climate and socioeconomic scenarios.

For more information on the broader scope of DesirMED, visit the [official Horizon Europe Project page](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101112972).

## Repository Highlights

This repository provides:

- **Python Scripts and Tools**: Geospatial analysis and climate-risk assessment.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize data and key metrics related to Mediterranean ecosystems.
- **Reports and Publications for both task will here**:

## How to Work on the Scripts together

To maintain an organized and efficient repository, follow these step-by-step instructions for contributing to the project scripts,:


## Step 1: Identify Your Focus Area
If you are working on a specific task (e.g., landscape characterization), navigate to the relevant folder in the repository. For instance:
- **Landscape Characterization**: `scripts/landscape_characterization/`
- **Climate Risk Profiling**: `scripts/climate_risk_profiles/`

## Step 2: Fork the Repository
Fork the repository to your personal GitHub account by clicking the **Fork** button on the repository page.

## Step 3: Clone Your Fork
Clone your forked repository to your local machine using:
git clone https://github.com/deltares-desirmed/WP4-Tasks.git


## Step 4: Request Contributor Access (Optional)
If you are working on a specific task (e.g., landscape characterization), navigate to the relevant folder in the repository. For instance:
If you intend to contribute directly, submit a **Contributor Access Request** to the repository maintainers. Ensure you have reviewed the contribution guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.


### Step 5: Make Your Changes
Add your new scripts, analytical tools, or updates to the appropriate folder. Ensure your changes are well-documented with clear descriptions in the script headers or markdown files. For example:
- Purpose of the script
- Input requirements
- Expected outputs


### Step 6: Test Your Changes
Run all necessary tests locally to ensure your additions work correctly and do not break existing scripts. For instance:
python scripts/landscape_characterization/your_script.py



### Step 7: Commit Your Changes
Stage and commit your changes with clear and concise messages:
git add.
git commit -m "Add new analysis for landscape characterization"


### Step 8: Push and Create a Pull Request
Push your changes to your forked repository:
git push origin main
Navigate to the original repository and create a Pull Request (PR) with a detailed description of your updates.


### Step 9: Engage in Review
Respond promptly to feedback from repository maintainers or reviewers. Make requested updates and resubmit the PR if necessary:
git push origin main. Make requested updates and resubmit the PR if necessary:

# Edit the code as per feedback
git add .
git commit -m "Update analysis based on review feedback"
git push origin main
