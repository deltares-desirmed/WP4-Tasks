## Project Scope

**DesirMED** is a Horizon Europe-funded initiative focused on addressing the unique challenges posed by climate change in the Mediterranean region. This repository highlights the work from **Work Packages (WP) 4.1 and 4.2**, which aim to:

- Identify critical landscape features essential for climate resilience.
- Develop risk profiles integrating environmental, climatic, and socioeconomic data.
- Provide nature-based solutions (NbS) for adaptive governance and ecosystem preservation.

### Key Objectives
- **Preserve and restore ecosystems** by leveraging NbS.
- **Build climate resilience** using innovative analytical tools.
- **Support decision-making** through risk modeling and stakeholder engagement.

---

### Focus of This Repository
This repository supports the development and open source sharing of codes and analytical information useful to complete both tasks **Work Package 4 (System Knowledge, Data & Design)**, particularly:

1. **Task 4.1**: Identifying Key Landscape Features
   - Characterizing Mediterranean landscapes in terms of climate resilience, resources, and ecosystem services.
   - Mapping landscape interconnections to understand shared resources and services.

2. **Task 4.2**: Developing Regional Risk Profiles
   - Synthesizing climate-related risks across Demonstrating and Replicating Regions.
   - Creating risk profile metrics that integrate climate and socioeconomic scenarios.

For more information on the broader scope of DesirMED, visit the [official Horizon Europe Project page](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101112972).
